The following table lists detailed information on the Azul Zulu versions released with the current update. Azul Zulu Version (*) Update Type (**) JDK VersionThe JDK version that is used in this release of Azul Zulu. Based onThe previous version of Azul Zulu that was used as the basis for the current version. JavaFX VersionThe version of JavaFX that is included in this release of Azul Zulu.

Azul ensures that the software that uses the Accessible APIs of the product doesn’t have to include specific licenses and that such use doesn’t contaminate the code or intellectual property of such software with any license requirements. CA are Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK that are free to download and use. Note Both SA and CA distributions may contain Early Access builds noted with -ea- in their filename. Early Access builds may not be TCK certified. (**) Update type: CPU (Critical Patch Updates) contain fixes to security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes. Azul Zulu CPU releases are generally based on prior-cycle PSU releases, with only security fixes applied. They provide a low-risk vehicle for the potentially urgent deployment of security fixes when issues of sufficient severity arise. CPU releases are available in SA distributions. PSU (Patch Set Updates) incorporates all fixes in the corresponding CPU, as well as additional non-security bug fixes. Azul Zulu PSU releases incorporate both security fixes and other changes that align the release contents with the associated OpenJDK project quarterly release. PSU releases are available in SA and CA distributions. What’s New Configuration Changes We reduced the testing cycles for the following environment targeting its end of life, and this is no longer supported: Windows Server 2012 R2 If you’re still using this platform, we will be providing Azul Platform Core versions for you and can help you if issues would arise! Please email us at [email protected]. Note Although previously announced in V1.0 of this document, macOS 12 Monterey and RHEL 7.x are longer supported and testing is not reduced yet for these platforms. Dropped Support for OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE OpenJSSE is a JSSE provider that was ported from Java 11 to Azul Zulu 8 to add support for TLS 1.3, because OpenJDK 8 did not support TLS 1.3 at the time. Later, OpenJSSE was integrated into the SunJSSE provider of OpenJDK 8u272 and became part of Java SE 8 specification. Legacy8uJSSE is a JSSE provider that falls back to legacy TLS 1.2 protocol implementation and was added to Azul Zulu 8 for compatibility reasons. Although earlier announced that they would be removed in January 2022, the two JSSE implementations got supported until this release, but will now be gradually dropped: The January 2024 PSU Builds of OpenJDK no longer support OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. The January 2024 CPU Builds are the last with OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. Encryption Configuration Changes for FIPS-enabled Configurations With the update of BCFIPS library from version 1.0.2.3 to 1.0.2.4, the following changes took place: PKCS 1.5 RSA encryption, Triple-DES encryption, and MD5 digest are now disabled in the ApprovedOnlyMode by default. These algorithms can be enabled for internal usage by the BCFIPS library with the following system properties:  org.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_drbg\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_prf\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_wrap\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_enc\norg.bouncycastle.rsa.allow_pkcs15_enc\norg.bouncycastle.jsse.enable_md5 New configurations of Azul Zulu with CRaC Support Zulu Builds with CRaC are now available for Alpine Linux (musl libc). In the following weeks, downloads will be available for Windows and macOS of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK with CRaC support for development purposes. With these runtimes you will be able to simulate the CRaC functionality. When a checkpoint is requested, it will be created and immediately restored without dumping the checkpoint to disk. This enables you to develop and test the CRaC functionality on these platforms, so you can deploy your application with confidence on Linux. IANA Time Zone Database Version This release of Azul Zulu comes with IANA Time Zone Database version 2023c, the same as in the release of October 2023.

Azul ensures that the software that uses the Accessible APIs of the product doesn’t have to include specific licenses and that such use doesn’t contaminate the code or intellectual property of such software with any license requirements. CA are Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK that are free to download and use. Note Both SA and CA distributions may contain Early Access builds noted with -ea- in their filename. Early Access builds may not be TCK certified. (**) Update type: CPU (Critical Patch Updates) contain fixes to security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes. Azul Zulu CPU releases are generally based on prior-cycle PSU releases, with only security fixes applied. They provide a low-risk vehicle for the potentially urgent deployment of security fixes when issues of sufficient severity arise. CPU releases are available in SA distributions. PSU (Patch Set Updates) incorporates all fixes in the corresponding CPU, as well as additional non-security bug fixes. Azul Zulu PSU releases incorporate both security fixes and other changes that align the release contents with the associated OpenJDK project quarterly release. PSU releases are available in SA and CA distributions."

  "content" : "What’s New Configuration Changes We reduced the testing cycles for the following environment targeting its end of life, and this is no longer supported: Windows Server 2012 R2 If you’re still using this platform, we will be providing Azul Platform Core versions for you and can help you if issues would arise! Please email us at [email protected]. Note Although previously announced in V1.0 of this document, macOS 12 Monterey and RHEL 7.x are longer supported and testing is not reduced yet for these platforms. Dropped Support for OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE OpenJSSE is a JSSE provider that was ported from Java 11 to Azul Zulu 8 to add support for TLS 1.3, because OpenJDK 8 did not support TLS 1.3 at the time. Later, OpenJSSE was integrated into the SunJSSE provider of OpenJDK 8u272 and became part of Java SE 8 specification. Legacy8uJSSE is a JSSE provider that falls back to legacy TLS 1.2 protocol implementation and was added to Azul Zulu 8 for compatibility reasons. Although earlier announced that they would be removed in January 2022, the two JSSE implementations got supported until this release, but will now be gradually dropped: The January 2024 PSU Builds of OpenJDK no longer support OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. The January 2024 CPU Builds are the last with OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. Encryption Configuration Changes for FIPS-enabled Configurations With the update of BCFIPS library from version 1.0.2.3 to 1.0.2.4, the following changes took place: PKCS 1.5 RSA encryption, Triple-DES encryption, and MD5 digest are now disabled in the ApprovedOnlyMode by default. These algorithms can be enabled for internal usage by the BCFIPS library with the following system properties:  org.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_drbg\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_prf\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_wrap\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_enc\norg.bouncycastle.rsa.allow_pkcs15_enc\norg.bouncycastle.jsse.enable_md5 New configurations of Azul Zulu with CRaC Support Zulu Builds with CRaC are now available for Alpine Linux (musl libc). In the following weeks, downloads will be available for Windows and macOS of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK with CRaC support for development purposes. With these runtimes you will be able to simulate the CRaC functionality. When a checkpoint is requested, it will be created and immediately restored without dumping the checkpoint to disk. This enables you to develop and test the CRaC functionality on these platforms, so you can deploy your application with confidence on Linux."
