Azul ensures that the software that uses the Accessible APIs of the product doesn’t have to include specific licenses and that such use doesn’t contaminate the code or intellectual property of such software with any license requirements. CA are Azul Zulu builds of OpenJDK that are free to download and use. Note Both SA and CA distributions may contain Early Access builds noted with -ea- in their filename. Early Access builds may not be TCK certified. (**) Update type: CPU (Critical Patch Updates) contain fixes to security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes. Azul Zulu CPU releases are generally based on prior-cycle PSU releases, with only security fixes applied. They provide a low-risk vehicle for the potentially urgent deployment of security fixes when issues of sufficient severity arise. CPU releases are available in SA distributions. PSU (Patch Set Updates) incorporates all fixes in the corresponding CPU, as well as additional non-security bug fixes. Azul Zulu PSU releases incorporate both security fixes and other changes that align the release contents with the associated OpenJDK project quarterly release. PSU releases are available in SA and CA distributions. What’s New Configuration Changes We reduced the testing cycles for the following environment targeting its end of life, and this is no longer supported: Windows Server 2012 R2 If you’re still using this platform, we will be providing Azul Platform Core versions for you and can help you if issues would arise! Please email us at [email protected]. Note Although previously announced in V1.0 of this document, macOS 12 Monterey and RHEL 7.x are longer supported and testing is not reduced yet for these platforms. Dropped Support for OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE OpenJSSE is a JSSE provider that was ported from Java 11 to Azul Zulu 8 to add support for TLS 1.3, because OpenJDK 8 did not support TLS 1.3 at the time. Later, OpenJSSE was integrated into the SunJSSE provider of OpenJDK 8u272 and became part of Java SE 8 specification. Legacy8uJSSE is a JSSE provider that falls back to legacy TLS 1.2 protocol implementation and was added to Azul Zulu 8 for compatibility reasons. Although earlier announced that they would be removed in January 2022, the two JSSE implementations got supported until this release, but will now be gradually dropped: The January 2024 PSU Builds of OpenJDK no longer support OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. The January 2024 CPU Builds are the last with OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. Encryption Configuration Changes for FIPS-enabled Configurations With the update of BCFIPS library from version 1.0.2.3 to 1.0.2.4, the following changes took place: PKCS 1.5 RSA encryption, Triple-DES encryption, and MD5 digest are now disabled in the ApprovedOnlyMode by default. These algorithms can be enabled for internal usage by the BCFIPS library with the following system properties:  org.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_drbg\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_prf\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_wrap\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_enc\norg.bouncycastle.rsa.allow_pkcs15_enc\norg.bouncycastle.jsse.enable_md5 New configurations of Azul Zulu with CRaC Support Zulu Builds with CRaC are now available for Alpine Linux (musl libc). In the following weeks, downloads will be available for Windows and macOS of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK with CRaC support for development purposes. With these runtimes you will be able to simulate the CRaC functionality. When a checkpoint is requested, it will be created and immediately restored without dumping the checkpoint to disk. This enables you to develop and test the CRaC functionality on these platforms, so you can deploy your application with confidence on Linux. IANA Time Zone Database Version This release of Azul Zulu comes with IANA Time Zone Database version 2023c, the same as in the release of October 2023.

Azul ensures that the software that uses the Accessible APIs of the product doesn’t have to include specific licenses and that such use doesn’t contaminate the code or intellectual property of such software with any license requirements. CA are Azul Zulu builds of OpenJDK that are free to download and use. Note Both SA and CA distributions may contain Early Access builds noted with -ea- in their filename. Early Access builds may not be TCK certified. (**) Update type: CPU (Critical Patch Updates) contain fixes to security vulnerabilities and critical bug fixes. Azul Zulu CPU releases are generally based on prior-cycle PSU releases, with only security fixes applied. They provide a low-risk vehicle for the potentially urgent deployment of security fixes when issues of sufficient severity arise. CPU releases are available in SA distributions. PSU (Patch Set Updates) incorporates all fixes in the corresponding CPU, as well as additional non-security bug fixes. Azul Zulu PSU releases incorporate both security fixes and other changes that align the release contents with the associated OpenJDK project quarterly release. PSU releases are available in SA and CA distributions."

  "content" : "What’s New Configuration Changes We reduced the testing cycles for the following environment targeting its end of life, and this is no longer supported: Windows Server 2012 R2 If you’re still using this platform, we will be providing Azul Platform Core versions for you and can help you if issues would arise! Please email us at [email protected]. Note Although previously announced in V1.0 of this document, macOS 12 Monterey and RHEL 7.x are longer supported and testing is not reduced yet for these platforms. Dropped Support for OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE OpenJSSE is a JSSE provider that was ported from Java 11 to Azul Zulu 8 to add support for TLS 1.3, because OpenJDK 8 did not support TLS 1.3 at the time. Later, OpenJSSE was integrated into the SunJSSE provider of OpenJDK 8u272 and became part of Java SE 8 specification. Legacy8uJSSE is a JSSE provider that falls back to legacy TLS 1.2 protocol implementation and was added to Azul Zulu 8 for compatibility reasons. Although earlier announced that they would be removed in January 2022, the two JSSE implementations got supported until this release, but will now be gradually dropped: The January 2024 PSU Builds of OpenJDK no longer support OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. The January 2024 CPU Builds are the last with OpenJSSE and Legacy8uJSSE. Encryption Configuration Changes for FIPS-enabled Configurations With the update of BCFIPS library from version 1.0.2.3 to 1.0.2.4, the following changes took place: PKCS 1.5 RSA encryption, Triple-DES encryption, and MD5 digest are now disabled in the ApprovedOnlyMode by default. These algorithms can be enabled for internal usage by the BCFIPS library with the following system properties:  org.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_drbg\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_prf\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_wrap\norg.bouncycastle.tripledes.allow_enc\norg.bouncycastle.rsa.allow_pkcs15_enc\norg.bouncycastle.jsse.enable_md5 New configurations of Azul Zulu with CRaC Support Zulu Builds with CRaC are now available for Alpine Linux (musl libc). In the following weeks, downloads will be available for Windows and macOS of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK with CRaC support for development purposes. With these runtimes you will be able to simulate the CRaC functionality. When a checkpoint is requested, it will be created and immediately restored without dumping the checkpoint to disk. This enables you to develop and test the CRaC functionality on these platforms, so you can deploy your application with confidence on Linux."

The command above simply executes java. To run a Java application, you must provide your application classes and resources to the java command. You do this by mounting a local directory from the container. As an example, let’s assume that your application files are located in a single directory. You would normally run the app by executing java MyApp in that directory. Use the -v option of docker run to make the directory available inside the container.

  "content" : "Install Azul Zulu with MSI installer Note For per-machine installation, you must have administrator privileges to run the .msi installer. When running an Azul Zulu MSI installer, you can select the features that you want to enable and/or change the installation folder. Optional features include: Add to PATH - Adds the <installation_folder>\\bin folder to the PATH environment variable. Set JAVA_HOME variable - (Not available in Azul Zulu 6 and 7) Sets the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation directory. JavaSoft (Oracle) registry keys - Overwrites JavaSoft (Oracle) registry keys (for details, see Azul Zulu registry keys). Install using Setup Wizard Double-click the downloaded .msi file to launch the Setup Wizard and follow the instructions in the wizard. The default installation folder is C:\\Program Files\\Zulu\\<zulu_dir>\\, where <zulu_dir> depends on the type of package (JDK or JRE). Package Installation Folder Example JDK zulu-<major_version> zulu-11 JRE zulu-<major_version>-jre zulu-11-jre To verify your Azul Zulu installation, run the following command:  <installation_folder>\\bin\\java -version If you chose to update the PATH environment variable during installation, simply run:  java -version You should see output similar to the following:  openjdk version \"11.0.10\" 2021-01-19 LTS\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.45+27-CA (build 11.0.10+9-LTS)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.45+27-CA (build 11.0.10+9-LTS, mixed mode) Install from Command Prompt To install Azul Zulu MSI installer from a Command Prompt, follow these steps: Open a command prompt or terminal window in the directory where you saved the .msi file. The general installation command looks like as follows:  msiexec /i <zulu_package>.msi ADDLOCAL=<feature1>,...,<featureN> INSTALLDIR=\"<absolute_path_to_dir>\" /qn The following features are available: ZuluInstallation - installs Azul Zulu into the specified location FeatureEnvironment - updates the PATH environment variable FeatureOracleJavaSoft - updates the registry keys under the HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\ section FeatureJavaHome - sets the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation directory Note These features are only supported since the October 2021 releases, e.g. version 8u312 or newer of JDK8. To enable a specific feature, add the name of the feature to the ADDLOCAL parameter. For example, to install Azul Zulu and update the PATH environment variable, run the following command:  msiexec /i zulu11.50.19-ca-jdk11.0.12-win_x64.msi ADDLOCAL=ZuluInstallation,FeatureEnvironment INSTALLDIR=\"c:\\java\\jdk11\" /qn Example 1 To install Azul Zulu into the default installation folder, run:  msiexec /i zulu11.50.19-ca-jdk11.0.12-win_x64.msi /qn No optional features are selected. Example 2 To install Azul Zulu into the c:\\java\\jdk11\\ folder and add c:\\java\\jdk11\\bin to the PATH environment variable, run:  msiexec /i zulu11.50.19-ca-jdk11.0.12-win_x64.msi ADDLOCAL=ZuluInstallation,FeatureEnvironment INSTALLDIR=\"c:\\java\\jdk11\" /qn Example 3 To install Azul Zulu and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, run:  msiexec /i zulu11.50.19-ca-jdk11.0.12-win_x64.msi ADDLOCAL=ZuluInstallation,FeatureJavaHome INSTALLDIR=\"c:\\java\\jdk11\" /qn To verify that JAVA_HOME is set correctly, restart Command Prompt to update the list of environment variables and run:  > echo %JAVA_HOME%\nC:\\java\\jdk11 Per-user installation You can install Azul Zulu to be available only for a specific Windows user. This type of installation requires no administrator privileges and stores all the Azul Zulu files in the current user’s workspace. This installation type is added in the following Azul Zulu versions: 17.30, 15.36, 13.44, 11.52, 8.58, 7.50. To install Azul Zulu only for the current Windows user, use the option MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1 as shown in the example below.  msiexec /i zulu11.52.13-ca-jdk11.0.13-win_x64.msi ADDLOCAL=ZuluInstallation,FeatureEnvironment MSIINSTALLPERUSER=1 /qn When working with a per-user Azul Zulu instance, consider the following: Avoid using per-user and per-machine Azul Zulu installations simultaneously if the two have identical major version but different minor versions (for example, Azul Zulu 8.54 and 8.56). You cannot upgrade a per-user Azul Zulu installation to the per-machine type. You cannot use the FeatureOracleJavaSoft option (updates Windows registry keys under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\) with the per-user installation. The system PATH environment variable takes precedence over the user PATH. Thus, if a system has a per-machine and a per-user Azul Zulu instances both added to user/system PATH, calling Java from an arbitrary location runs the per-machine Azul Zulu instance. Azul Zulu registry keys During the installation, the MSI installer uses the registry to store path and version information. The installer creates two sets of registry keys depending on the installation type: per-machine installation creates Azul Zulu keys and Generic keys. Generic keys are typically created by Java installers and are used to ensure Azul Zulu is compatible with other tools such as Launch4j and WinRun4J. per-user installation creates only Azul Zulu keys. The table below shows the registry keys created during the installation of various types of Azul Zulu packages. Binary type Azul Zulu keys Generic keys Installation: per-machine JRE 64-bit HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Azul Systems\\Zulu\\zulu-<version>-jre HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment JRE 32-bit HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Azul Systems\\Zulu 32-bit\\zulu-<version>-jre HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Runtime Environment JDK 64-bit HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Azul Systems\\Zulu\\zulu-<version> HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JavaSoft\\Java Development Kit JDK 32-bit HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Azul Systems\\Zulu 32-bit\\zulu-<version> HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\JavaSoft\\Java Development Kit Installation: per-user JRE 64-bit HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Azul Systems\\Zulu\\zulu-<version>-jre N/A JRE 32-bit HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Azul Systems\\Zulu 32-bit\\zulu-<version>-jre N/A JDK 64-bit HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Azul Systems\\Zulu\\zulu-<version> N/A JDK 32-bit HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Azul Systems\\Zulu 32-bit\\zulu-<version> N/A Where <version> in zulu-<version>-jre stands for the version of Azul Zulu, for example, zulu-11-jre. The MSI Installer creates registry keys during Azul Zulu installation and removes these keys during uninstallation. Please note that the MSI Installer creates the Generic keys only if Oracle Java has not yet been installed on the computer. If Java is already installed, this means that the keys exist, and the installer does not overwrite them."

For Azul Zulu 8 and earlier, the version consists of 4 numbers: XX.YY.0.BB, the third number is always \"0\". For Azul Zulu 11 and later, the version consists of 3 numbers: XX.YY.BB. Note For each quarterly release, the release version is defined by the major version and minor version (first two numbers, XX.YY). The build number (BB) may vary within a release. As of April 2021 release, the Azul Zulu versions use the following scheme: Azul Zulu Major Version Full Version Format 8 and earlier XX.YY.0.BB 11 and later XX.YY.BB The following table explains the meaning of XX, YY, and BB. XX The major version. YY The minor version. even numbers indicate a PSU release odd numbers indicate a CPU release BB The build number. even numbers indicate an SA bundle odd numbers indicate a CA or NV bundle BB ≤ 50 indicate regular Update bundles 51 ≤ BB < 1000 indicate BPR (Bundled Patch Release) bundles BB ≥ 1000 indicate FVB (Fix Verification Bundle) bundles Note Based on building and testing results, the build number can be different within a release, typically grouping different platforms. Versioning Examples 8.54.0.21 - Azul Zulu 8, a CA bundle of a regular CPU release 8.54.0.22 - Azul Zulu 8, a SA bundle of a regular PSU release 8.54.0.56 - Azul Zulu 8, an SA bundle of a PSU-based bundled patch release (BPR) 8.54.0.1018 - Azul Zulu 8, an SA fix verification bundle (FVB) for a PSU release 11.48.22 - Azul Zulu 11, an SA bundle of a regular PSU release 13.39.15 - Azul Zulu 13, an NV bundle of a regular CPU release 15.32.54 - Azul Zulu 15, an SA bundle of a PSU-based bundled patch release (BPR) 11.48.1004 - Azul Zulu 11, an SA fix verification bundle (FVB) for a PSU release"

For example:  zulu15.31.14-sa-jre15.0.2.0.101-linux_musl_x64.tar.gz The following table details most common components that make up a name of downloadable Azul Zulu package. Bundle name part Description zulu15.29.14-sa-jdk15.0.2-linux_x64.tar.gz Azul Zulu Version. See Versioning Scheme for details. zulu15.29.14-sa-jdk15.0.2-linux_x64.tar.gz Distribution type (SA, CA, NV): sa - subscriber availability ca - community availability nv - \"non-verified\" builds zulu15.29.14-sa-jdk15.0.2-linux_x64.tar.gz Java functionality included in the bundle: jdk - Java Development Kit jre - Java Runtime Environment hl - Headless version of a JDK or JRE (without GUI components) fx-jdk - JDK with JavaFX support fx-jre - JRE with JavaFX support zulu15.29.14-sa-jdk15.0.2-linux_x64.tar.gz Java update version zulu15.29.14-sa-jdk15.0.2-linux_x64.tar.gz OS family: linux, linux_musl, win, macosx, solaris, qnx zulu15.29.14-sa-jdk15.0.2-linux_x64.tar.gz CPU architecture: x64, i686, i386, amd64, aarch64, aarch32sf, aarch32hf, ppc64, ppc32hf, ppc32spe, mips32sf Note Please note that Azul does not build bundles for all possible combinations of the values provided in the table above. Rather, you can use this table to understand what is included in a specific bundle. There are additional optional suffixes that may appear in the name of a bundle. For example:  zulu8.54.0.22-sa-cp2-embvm-jre8.0.292-c2-linux_ppc64.tar.gz Below is a description of the additional suffixes: Suffix Description beta or ea Early Access bundles. Both SA and CA distributions may contain Early Access builds noted with -beta- or -ea- in their filename. Early Access builds may not be TCK certified. embvm The bundle is built with the JAVASE_EMBEDDED option. Bundles with this suffix were discontinued in October 2021. cp1, cp2, or cp3 One of the Java SE Embedded Compact profiles. Read more about compact profiles at https://foojay.io/pedia/compactprofiles/. c2 Indicates that the bundle contains both Client and Server HotSpot JIT compilers. Bundles that don’t have this suffix contain only the Client compilers. This suffix can be present in bundles for the ARM 32-bit architecture. criu Bundles with the checkpoint/restore functionality. cr Bundles with the CRaM (Checkpoint / Restore at Main) functionality. crac Bundles with the CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) functionality. gcc9 Bundles compiled with the GCC 9 toolchain."

  "content" : "Overview of changes Where the Zulu Discovery APIs use the term bundle, the Metadata API uses the term package. While the Zulu Discovery APIs have different APIs for supported and free packages, the new Metadata API uses availability-type filters to determine if a package is freely available or not. All customer packages require an API token to download, similar to the token used by the old api.azul.com/zulu/download/sa/v1-early-access. Packages previously available from api.azul.com/zulu/download/community/v1.0 should use the filter availability-type=ca. Packages previously available from api.azul.com/zulu/download/sa/v1-early-access should use the filter availability-type=sa and must authenticate with an API token. Customers with a support contract can contact Azul Support ([email protected]) to get an API token. Azure-only has been deprecated, since no new azure only packages are being published. The Metadata API has dropped support for /bundles/latest* and /bundles/sha256* endpoints and added support for retrieving a package’s UUID using a SHA256 hash or MD5 hash. See below for examples of how to replace requests using the dropped endpoints."

  "content" : "The Azul Commercial Compatibility Kit (CCK) was created to narrow the gap between OpenJDK and Oracle JDK. When Sun released OpenJDK, many of the third party components that were present in the Sun Hotspot JDK required open source replacements. Not all components could be made open at that time, and some of them persist today and may cause compatibility problems when you move from Oracle JDK to a build of OpenJDK. These components of the closed-source Oracle JDK are not included in the OpenJDK project. They are not included in Azul Zulu as well because Azul Zulu is based on OpenJDK. The Azul Commercial Compatibility Kit is an add-on for Azul Zulu that provides alternatives to some of the missing components, but itself is not open-source. CCK is available for Azul Zulu 6, 7, and 8 and includes the following components: Monotype fonts. Monotype license in RTF format. Rhino JavaScript engine (in CCK 7 only) Note The Bigelow & Holmes Lucida family fonts (Lucida Sans, Lucida Bright, and Lucida Typewriter) fonts are licensed by Azul from Monotype for internal use only. If your product plans require that these fonts be available to your end customers, please contact your Azul representative."

IcedTea-Web follows the JNLP-specification defined in JSR-56. Azul provides builds of IcedTea-Web for multiple platforms. It should not be considered as a drop-in replacement and sometimes requires additional migration efforts. Our experience in large corporate projects, shows that a drop-in success rate of 95% is reached for applications switching from WebStart to IcedTea-Web. Azul Platform Core customers can contact [email protected] for any technical question or problem regarding IcedTea-Web. Note IcedTea-Web is tested and compatible with version 8 of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK. Support for version 11 is not tested and is not an officially supported combination, but in our experience, IcedTea-Web generally works with Zulu 11. Other Zulu versions are not known to work with IcedTea-Web. History of Java Web Start Java Web Start was a deployment technology, which allowed for an application to automatically install and update when the user runs it. It has been part of Java since version 5. Java Web Start applications were configured through files with the .jnlp extension for Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP). The JNLP extension was associated with the javaws.exe such that a Java Web Start application can be launched in the browser by double clicking it or from the command line with javaws <jnlp file or URL>. Java Web Start never became a part of the Java Standard (Java SE) and the source code was never released by Sun. It therefore was not made part of the OpenJDK. It was considered safer than Applets, but not safe enough for the Internet. Java Web Start has been deprecated for a while now."

  "content" : "History of Java Web Start Java Web Start was a deployment technology, which allowed for an application to automatically install and update when the user runs it. It has been part of Java since version 5. Java Web Start applications were configured through files with the .jnlp extension for Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP). The JNLP extension was associated with the javaws.exe such that a Java Web Start application can be launched in the browser by double clicking it or from the command line with javaws <jnlp file or URL>. Java Web Start never became a part of the Java Standard (Java SE) and the source code was never released by Sun. It therefore was not made part of the OpenJDK. It was considered safer than Applets, but not safe enough for the Internet. Java Web Start has been deprecated for a while now."

  "content" : "Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint (CRaC) is a JDK project that allows you to start Java programs with a shorter time to first transaction, combined with less time and resources to achieve full code speed. CRaC effectively takes a snapshot of the Java process (checkpoint) when it is fully warmed up, then uses that snapshot to launch any number of JVMs from this captured state. Not all existing Java programs can run without modification as all resources - using the CRaC API - need to be explicitly closed before you can create a checkpoint, and these resources must be reinitialized after the restore. Popular frameworks like Spring, Micronaut, and Quarkus support CRaC checkpointing out of the box."

  "link" : "https://docs.azul.com/core/crac/crac-introduction#why-crac",
  "content" : "Why CRaC? When an application starts running, the JVM looks for methods that are hot spots (hence the name HotSpot for the implementation of the JVM that is now the OpenJDK JVM), and compiles them to get better performance compared to interpreting the bytecodes. This results in fast, optimized code, but has the downside of the JVM needing both time and compute resources to determine which methods to compile and then compile them. This is what we refer to as the warmup time of an application. The fact that this same work has to happen every time we run an application makes the JVM less attractive in certain situations like microservices and serverless computing. With CRaC, you can create a checkpoint with the state of the JVM and its application, and start (restore) as many instances from that checkpoint as required. This reduces the time to load data and initialize the required structures, both on JVM and on application side. In contrast to the more generic Checkpoint/Restore approach implemented in CRIU, CRaC is designed to achieve multiple restores in different environments from a single checkpoint. CRaC imposes certain restrictions on the state of the application and JVM to guarantee the consistency and safety of the checkpoint. The checkpoint cannot succeed if the program has an open file handle. If the file that is referenced by a handle, changes, the checkpoint state will diverge from the environment. An attempt to use the handle after restore when the file has changed, will lead to unpredictable results. For this reason, CRaC requires that there are no open file handles and sockets when you create a checkpoint. However, this does not mean that only simple applications are compatible with CRaC. Applications can prepare themselves for the checkpoint to satisfy the requirements, and re-initialize themselves after restore. CRaC provides new Java APIs to register callbacks (resources) with two methods: beforeCheckpoint() and afterRestore(). As these names imply, you can run arbitrary code on checkpoint and restore, and you can satisfy CRaC’s requirements for the application state. Azul’s ReadyNow is another technology, which is part of Azul Prime Builds of OpenJDK, to offer warmup time reduction. ReadyNow allows a running application to store all the state of the compiled methods, and even the compiled code itself, without changing the application. Startup Improvement Results As part of this project, Azul created a proof-of-concept build of JDK 17 to demonstrate the CRaC functionality. The results from these first tests were very promising. For instance, with a sample Spring Boot application and in a test environment, the time before processing the first operation took roughly four seconds. By using a checkpoint of the running, warmed up application, a restore was able to get to the first operation in 40ms. That’s two orders of magnitude faster! The chart is based on experiments on the following environment: Laptop with Intel i7-5500U, 16Gb RAM and SSD. Linux kernel 5.7.4-arch1-1. The data was collected in a container running an ubuntu:18.04 based image. Host operating system: archlinux. Presentation The CRaC system was fully explained by Gerrit Grunwald, Developer Advocate of Azul at many conferences. This is the recording of his presentation at J-Spring in 2022."

  "content" : "Understanding How CRaC Influences the PID A traditional JVM process uses a single multi-threaded process. On Linux (and in other POSIX OSes) the process is identified by a numerical process identifier (PID). Java considered this an OS-specific implementation detail, therefore applications tried to obtain it e.g. by parsing ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName() or in more recent Java versions (>= 9) these could use ProcessHandle.current().pid(). Developers usually consider this a constant for the duration of the application. When a process terminates, it exits with an exit value between 0 and 255. By convention 0 signifies success (normal exit) and other values are used for different error states. Specifically, when the process is terminated by an unhandled signal it returns exit value 128+signal. Basic Checkpoint and Restore In the simplest form of checkpoint and restore (C/R), we have two processes: first the checkpointed one, and later on the restored process. When the C/R is performed using CRIU as a standalone binary it gets a bit more complex. CRIU, as a tool tailored for more complex use-cases than single process C/R, attempts to checkpoint not only its primary target (the process with all its threads), but the whole process group: the process with all its children and their children. When the checkpoint is initiated from the JVM process, CRIU would be a child process, too. That’s one reason why CRaC uses an intermediary process: criuengine. This process escapes the children hierarchy and then exec’s (*) CRIU. CRIU persists the state of the original JVM process and then terminates it, using KILL signal (9). That’s why a process that was correctly checkpointed returns exit code 128+9 = 137. (*) The term exec’s here refers to the exec in POSIX fork & exec pattern. It replaces the current program with a new program. When the JVM is restored, the process started with java -XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=… does not start the JVM. Instead it exec’s CRIU (through criuengine) which starts the restored process as its child. Since the process might have some internal dependency on its original PID, the restored child will have the same PID as the original checkpointed process. When CRIU is finished reconstructing the process, it exec’s into criuengine restorewait: the only task of this program is to wait until its only child (the restored JVM) exits and propagate its status. However, this means that now there are two processes and if a script that executed java -XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=… obtained this process’s PID value, it is not the PID of the restored process. While criuengine restorewait propagates all the signals it can, KILL and STOP signals cannot be handled (propagated) and therefore the restored JVM process would not be killed but only get orphaned. Creating a Checkpoint Visualization of the flow that creates a checkpoint from an application with PID 1234. Restoring a Checkpoint Visualization of the flow that restores a checkpoint to make it run again with PID 1234. Checkpointed Process Wrapper In some cases, such as when running the to-be-checkpointed JVM in a container, this might get even more complicated. In containers, unless wrapping the JVM process with a shell script, this would be running with the special PID value of 1. This would prohibit the 'escape' of criuengine checkpoint and the checkpoint would fail. Therefore, when the JVM is checkpointable and runs with PID 1 it turns into a dummy wrapper process and starts another process, the actual JVM. As a result, the container would again host two processes. In the future there might be other situations that would follow the checkpointed JVM termination with further actions, e.g. post-processing of the process image. For seamless experience in a shell, this post-execution would also require a wrapper that waits until all the work is done. If your scripts must use KILL or STOP signals these should send it to all processes within the group, e.g. using kill -9 -<pid>. Without CRIU While CRIU offers the most mature C/R implementation, the complexity of its task requires elevated capabilities. In the case of CRaC, at least the CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE and CAP_SYS_PTRACE. This might not be suitable in all deployment environments, particularly in restricted containers, and therefore the CRaC project explores other implementations as well. These might work with a different hierarchy of processes. One reason for these elevated permissions is the ability to use arbitrary PIDs for new processes/threads. Java programs usually do not use its PID extensively and other C/R implementations might relax this requirement. Therefore, it is highly advisable to not rely on its constness."

  "content" : "Running an Application With CRaC Currently, the CRaC functionality is only available on Linux/x64 and Linux/Arm64, in version 17 and 21 of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK. This means, for now, you can run an application with CRaC on any system thanks to the crac.org dependency, but only on the specified OS systems the CRaC functionality in the JVM will work. Note Some VMs, like Parallels, cannot run foreign CPU instructions, and you need a build matching your CPU. Some other virtualization environments, like WSL, do not provide a complete feature set of Linux kernel, limiting the CRaC functionality in the current version. Running CRaC on a Linux System Selecting a Runtime Currently, CRaC is only available on Linux/x64 and Linux/Arm64, in version 17 and 21 of Azul Zulu Builds of OpenJDK, as of the release of April 2023. Only the bundles with -crac- in the name, have the integrated CRaC functionality. On the download section of the Azul website, you can use the \"Java Package\" > \"JDK CRaC\" filter. Note The JDK archive should be extracted with sudo.  $ sudo tar zxf <jdk>.tar.gz Generating a Checkpoint Start the JVM with an additional flag -XX:CRaCCheckpointTo so it’s prepared to create a checkpoint:  java -XX:CRaCCheckpointTo=$HOME/crac-image/ -jar my_app.jar Note This eventually generates a set of files in the given directory, which cumulative size will be roughly the size of the JVM resident memory. Then you can use two ways to trigger the checkpoint: From outside the JVM, using jcmd with JDK.checkpoint. Programmatically within your application, by adding a call to Core.checkpointRestore() in the flow of your program, where you want the checkpoint to be created. The method will return when the restore has been completed. Using a Checkpoint When a checkpoint is available, you can (re)start your application and restore from the image:  java -XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=$HOME/crac-files/ Running CRaC in a Virtualized Environment (Docker) Creating a Docker Image You need an application in a runnable JAR file. Create a Dockerfile, based on the following minimum file:  FROM ubuntu:20.04\n\nRUN apt-get update -y\n\nADD \"https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.44.17-ca-crac-jdk17.0.8-linux_x64.tar.gz\" /opt/\nRUN cd /opt/ && tar -xzf zulu17.44.17-ca-crac-jdk17.0.8-linux_x64.tar.gz && rm zulu17.44.17-ca-crac-jdk17.0.8-linux_x64.tar.gz\n\nENV JAVA_HOME /opt/zulu17.44.17-ca-crac-jdk17.0.8-linux_x64\nENV PATH $JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n\nCOPY build/libs/my_app.jar /opt/app/my_app.jar Build the Docker image with:  docker build -t my_app_on_crac . Starting an Application in a Docker Container Run a Docker container with:  docker run -it --cap-add=CHECKPOINT_RESTORE --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --rm --name my_app_on_crac \\\n    -v $PWD/crac-files:/opt/crac-files my_app_on_crac \\\n    java -XX:CRaCCheckpointTo=/opt/crac-files -jar /opt/app/my_app.jar Note In order to restore without additional capabilities (see below), you should make java to be PID 1 process. Leave the shell window open and the application running. Creating the Checkpoint Open another shell window. In this window run:  docker exec my_app_on_crac jcmd PID-OR-NAME JDK.checkpoint Note You can find PID or NAME to provide to jcmd by executing just jcmd in the container. If everything is ok, you see that in the first shell window the checkpoint was created and your application was closed. Creating a Docker Image with Checkpoint Create a Dockerfile with the checkpoint:  FROM my_app_on_crac\nCOPY crac-files /opt/ Build the Docker image with  docker build -t my_app_on_crac_restore . Run the Docker Container From the Checkpoint Run:  docker run -it --rm --cap-add=SYS_RESOURCE my_app_on_crac_restore java \\\n    -XX:CRaCRestoreFrom=/opt/crac-files Your application now starts much faster from the saved checkpoint. Note A restore in an unprivileged container (without the SYS_RESOURCE capability) might succeed but we have identified some issues with stability related to the brk syscall; therefore it is strongly recommended to use this additional capability. NOTE: You can run the Docker container also on macOS or Windows, as long as the machine you are running it on has a x64 cpu architecture (Intel/AMD). Running CRaC on Windows or macOS You can test your CRaC application on Windows or macOS with one of the following approaches: Run your application in a virtualized Linux system, e.g. following the Docker approach described above. For instance, on macOS you can use Docker, Podman, Parallels, VirtualBox,… Use an Azul Zulu Build of OpenJDK with CRaC support for development purposes, available for Windows and macOS. These provide a simulated checkpoint/restore mechanism to be used for development and testing."

  "content" : "This guide assumes you’re familiar with the concepts and API of CRaC, and how a checkpoint can be created and used. Please check out the \"Usage Guidelines\" first. Applications and its components often have a simple lifecycle. The application boots, then it is actively used, and in the end it enters shutdown and finally ends up in a terminated state, unable to start back. If the same functionality is needed again, the component is re-created. This allows simpler reasoning and some performance optimizations by making fields final, or not protecting the access to an uninitialized component as the developer knows that it is not published yet. While usually most of the application can stay as-is, the lifecycle of some components may need to implement the CRaC methods to transition from active to a suspended state and back. In the suspended state, until the whole VM is terminated or before the component is restored, the rest of the application can still be running and can access the component - e.g. a pool of network connections. At that moment, the component is unusable. One solution is to block the thread and unblock it when the component is ready to be used again. The implementation of this synchronization depends mostly on the threading model of the application. In this guide, the synchronized component is referred as resource, even though it might not implement the Resource interface directly."

  "content" : "Implementing Resource as Inner Class In order to encapsulate the functionality, the Resource interface is sometimes not implemented directly by the component, but in an (anonymous) inner class. However, it is not sufficient to pass this resource to the Context.register() method. Contexts usually hold references to resources using weak references. As there is no unregister method on the Context, a strong reference prevents the component from being garbage-collected when the application releases it. Therefore, the inner class needs to be stored inside the component (in a field) to prevent garbage-collection:  public class Component {\n    private final Resource cracHandler;\n\n    public Component() {\n        /* other initialization */\n        cracHandler = new Resource() {\n            @Override\n            public void beforeCheckpoint(Context<? extends Resource> context) {\n                /* ... */\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public void afterRestore(Context<? extends Resource> context) {\n                /* ... */\n            }\n        }\n        /* When using just .register(new Resource() { ... }) in here\n           it would be immediately garbage-collected. */\n        Core.getGlobalContext().register(cracHandler);\n    }\n}"

  "content" : "Common CRaC Patterns Unknown Number of Threads Arriving Randomly When you don’t have any guarantees about who is calling into the resource, any access can be blocked with java.util.concurrent.ReadWriteLock. Any existing access to an object is guarded by the Read lock, introducing no changes to the way the object is used. However, beforeCheckpoint() acquires the Write lock, and afterRestore() releases the Write lock. Therefore, the idea of the pattern is to block the checkpoint until all regular accesses to the object are finished.  public class ConnectionPool implements Resource {\n    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();\n    private final Lock readLock = lock.readLock();\n    private final Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();\n\n    /* Constructor registers this Resource */\n    public Connection getConnection() {\n        readLock.lock();\n        try {\n            /* actual code fetching the connection */\n            /* In this example the access to the connection itself\n               is not protected and the application must be able\n               to handle a closed connection. */\n        } finally {\n            readLock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void beforeCheckpoint(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        writeLock.lock();\n        /* close all connections */\n        /* Note: if this method throws an exception CRaC will try\n        to restore the resource by calling afterRestore() -\n        no need to unlock the lock here */\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterRestore(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        try {\n            /* initialize connections if needed */\n        } finally {\n            writeLock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n} This solution has the obvious drawback of adding contention on the hot path, the getConnection() method. Even though the readers won’t block each other, the implementation of read locking likely has to perform some atomic writes which aren’t cost-free. CRaC might eventually provide an optimized version for this read-write locking pattern that would move most of the cost to the write lock as this removes the need to optimize for checkpoint performance. One or Known Number of Periodically Arriving Threads When there is only a single thread, e.g. fetching a task from a queue, or a known number of parties that arrive to the component often enough, a more efficient solution can be used. The following example shows the use of a resource that logs data to a file, and assumes that the checkpoint notifications are invoked from another thread. This is the case when the checkpoint creation is triggered through jcmd <pid> JDK.checkpoint. java.util.concurrent.Phaser is used because it has a non-interruptible version of waiting.  public class Logger implements Resource {\n    private final int N = 1; // number of threads calling write()\n    private volatile Phaser phaser;\n\n    public void write(Chunk data) throws IOException {\n        checkForCheckpoint();\n        /* do the actual write */\n    }\n\n    public void checkForCheckpoint() throws IOException {\n        Phaser phaser = this.phaser;\n        if (phaser != null) {\n            if (phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance() < 0) {\n                throw new IllegalStateException(\"Shouldn't terminate here\");\n            }\n            /* now the resource is suspended */\n            if (phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance() < 0) {\n                throw new IOException(\"File could not be open after restore\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void beforeCheckpoint(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        phaser = new Phaser(N + 1); // +1 for self\n        phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();\n        /* close file being written */\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterRestore(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        Phaser phaser = this.phaser;\n        this.phaser = null;\n        try {\n            /* reopen the file */\n            phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            phaser.forceTermination();\n            throw e;\n        }\n    }\n} Only one volatile read is required for synchronization on each write() call, which is generally a cheap operation. However, if one of the expected threads is waiting for a long time, the checkpoint would be blocked. This can be mitigated by using shorter timeouts (e.g. if the thread is polling a queue) or even actively interrupting it from the beforeCheckpoint method. Event Loop Model In case there is a single thread doing request processing, it’s possible to synchronize its execution with the checkpoint. The idea of this pattern is to schedule the work that will quiescent the thread on the checkpoint, and block the checkpoint until the work is encountered. The body of the work should unblock the checkpoint and keep the processing thread in the quiescent state until the restore is complete. The following example shows a resource sending a heartbeat message.  public class HeartbeatManager implements Runnable, Resource {\n    public final ScheduledExecutorService eventloop; // single-threaded\n    public boolean suspended;\n\n    public HeartbeatManager(Executor eventloop) {\n        eventloop.scheduleAtFixedRate(this, 0, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        /* send heartbeat message */\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void beforeCheckpoint(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        synchronized (this) {\n            HeartbeatManager self = this;\n            executor.execute(() -> {\n                synchronized (self) {\n                    self.suspended = true;\n                    self.notify();\n                    while (self.suspended) {\n                        self.wait();\n                    }\n                }\n            })\n            while (!suspended) {\n                wait();\n            }\n        }\n        /* shutdown */\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterRestore(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        /* restore */\n        synchronized (this) {\n            suspended = false;\n            notify();\n        }\n    }\n} Beware that if the single-threaded executor is shared between several components this solution is not applicable in the current form as one resource would block and the others would not be able to get suspended. In this case, it makes sense to centralize the control into one resource per executor, but this is out of scope of this document. Also note one detail in the example above: if the application is stopped for a long time the task scheduled by the ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(…) tries to keep up after restore and perform all the missed invocations. Handling this behavior, must be a part of the beforeCheckpoint procedure, cancelling the task and rescheduling it again in afterRestore."

  "content" : "Unknown Number of Threads Arriving Randomly When you don’t have any guarantees about who is calling into the resource, any access can be blocked with java.util.concurrent.ReadWriteLock. Any existing access to an object is guarded by the Read lock, introducing no changes to the way the object is used. However, beforeCheckpoint() acquires the Write lock, and afterRestore() releases the Write lock. Therefore, the idea of the pattern is to block the checkpoint until all regular accesses to the object are finished.  public class ConnectionPool implements Resource {\n    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();\n    private final Lock readLock = lock.readLock();\n    private final Lock writeLock = lock.writeLock();\n\n    /* Constructor registers this Resource */\n    public Connection getConnection() {\n        readLock.lock();\n        try {\n            /* actual code fetching the connection */\n            /* In this example the access to the connection itself\n               is not protected and the application must be able\n               to handle a closed connection. */\n        } finally {\n            readLock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void beforeCheckpoint(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        writeLock.lock();\n        /* close all connections */\n        /* Note: if this method throws an exception CRaC will try\n        to restore the resource by calling afterRestore() -\n        no need to unlock the lock here */\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterRestore(Context<? extends Resource> context) throws Exception {\n        try {\n            /* initialize connections if needed */\n        } finally {\n            writeLock.unlock();\n        }\n    }\n} This solution has the obvious drawback of adding contention on the hot path, the getConnection() method. Even though the readers won’t block each other, the implementation of read locking likely has to perform some atomic writes which aren’t cost-free. CRaC might eventually provide an optimized version for this read-write locking pattern that would move most of the cost to the write lock as this removes the need to optimize for checkpoint performance."

Restore can be executed without these privileges under root user. When you confirm that this is set correctly but the checkpoint still fails, you can get additional insight from the dump4.log file located in the image directory (-XX:CRaCCheckpointTo)."

  "content" : "Restore Conflict of PIDs Errors can also happen during restore. While on baremetal the deployment PIDs usually don’t clash, in containers starting from PID 1, this is more likely. Such an error looks like this:  Error (criu/cr-restore.c:1506): Can't fork for 9: File exists\nError (criu/cr-restore.c:2593): Restoring FAILED. The message is a bit misleading: the error is not related to files. In this example, CRIU tried to restore a process or thread with PID 9 but found that there is already an existing process/thread with this PID. If you check ps faux it’s possible that you won’t find that process - the restore itself spins up some processes that could clash and die due to unsuccessful restore. If the clash happens due to restoring a process, it might be sufficient to attempt the restore several times, until there is no conflict. The error above should not be confused with another one:  Error (criu/cr-restore.c:1506): Can't fork for 9: Read-only file system\nError (criu/cr-restore.c:2593): Restoring FAILED.\nError (criu/cr-restore.c:1823): Pid 20 do not match expected 9 This is rather a sign that CRIU has insufficient privileges to write into ns_last_pid and/or call clone3, a syscall forking the process with a specific PID. CRIU can work around the missing permissions if it can cycle up to the desired PID, but if it is lower than the current PID, it won’t cycle through the full range set in the operating system. One trick that can be used in containers is to ensure that before the checkpoint, PIDs are higher than anything needed for the restore, either writing /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid or cycling dummy processes until ns_last_pid is higher than the required value (128 might be a good starting point). More info about how PIDs are handled in a CRaC checkpoint/restore flow, is described in the Anatomy of CRaC Processes."

  "content" : "Note File Descriptors are available since zulu17.46, zulu21.30 (October 2023). CRaC requires that the application closes all open files, network connections etc. On Linux these are represented as file descriptors. However, it might be difficult to alter the application to properly coordinate with the checkpoint, e.g. due to a code in a library you cannot modify. In those cases, CRaC offers a limited handling via configuration. Note The configuration described here is experimental and work-in-progress functionality, to get feedback from you as a user. Please contact Azul Support ([email protected]) when you discover problems or have ideas for further improvements. The configuration is set up by pointing the system property jdk.crac.resource-policies to a file that consists of several rules separated by three dashes (---). Lines starting with the hash sign (#) are ignored. Each rule consists of several key: value pairs. This is actually a subset of YAML format, so we suggest that you use the .yaml or .yml extension for convenient use in an editor. Note What is described here, only applies to file descriptors opened through the JDK API. Anything opened through native code, cannot be handled this way. See an example of this file:  type: file\npath: /path/to/my/file\naction: close\n---\n# Here is some comment\ntype: FILE\npath: **/*.log\naction: reopen Each rule has two mandatory properties: type and action, with case-insensitive values. Available types are: file: A file (or directory) on a local filesystem. pipe: An anonymous pipe - named pipes are handled using the type file. socket: Network (TCP, UDP, …) or unix socket. filedescriptor: Raw file descriptor that cannot be identified by any of the above. The order of rules in the file is important; for each file descriptor that is found open, the first matching rule will be applied, any subsequent rules are ignored."

Previously, you had to use the option -XX+:PrintGCDetails. You can view these metrics now by default in GC Log Analyzer in the GC CPU Usage graph. GC CPU Usage is split into 3 metrics, \"marking CPU usage,\" \"relocation CPU usage,\" and \"fixup pass,\" which appear as \"New GC Mark,\" \"New GC Reloc,\" and \"New GC Fixup\" in the GC CPU Usage graph. Azul Platform Prime 24.01.0.0 includes a new lightweight, fully functional distribution of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Java 8, 11, 17 and 21. The new Java JREs saves a significant amount of space by removing various debugging options and developer options. The Azul Platform Prime Builds of JRE still fully supports Optimizer Hub and Azul Vulnerability Detection (AVD). Azul Platform Prime 24.01.0.0 introduces a small but significant change to the behavior of -XX:ProfileStartupLimitInSeconds. Now, when you set this option to 0, it means 0 seconds. Previously, if you set this flag to 0, it would be interpreted as \"infinite\". You can still specify \"infinite\" by using any negative number, for example -1. The default behavior without setting this option remains the same, i.e. the default value has changed from 0 to -1. January 2024 CPU and PSU release security fixes.

More concise logging of the Compilation Ranking feature has been implemented in order to better asses the behavior and impact of this feature. This applies to Falcon compilations only. Newly collected data has been added to the pre-existing charts in GC Log Analyzer, Compiler Statistics > Compiler Queues and Compiler Statistic > Tier 2 Compiler Counts. Newly collected and viewable data includes the following: The total number of hot and warm methods which have made it to the compile queue, split from the total number of methods. The total number of hot and warm methods which have begun compilation, split from the total number of methods. The total number of methods which were not promoted to the compiler queue due to being identified as cold methods. These are methods which have reached the compile threshold, but not quickly enough to be considered warm or hot methods. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release.

This allows the Falcon compiler to assign ranks, hot, warm, or cold, to methods in order to prioritize system resources to methods depending on their hotness. The value of compilation ranking is that compiler activity is optimized later in an application run, not only reducing system load and freeing up resources for the running application but also reducing application outliers. For more information on compilation ranks, see Analyzing and Tuning Warmup. For newly added options, see Command Line Options. As of Azul Platform Prime 23.08.0.0, ZVision and ZVRobot components have been deprecated and are no longer actively developed. While we still support these components, we encourage users to switch to Java Flight Recorder, as ZVision and ZVRobot are planned for End-of-Life with Azul Platform Prime 24.02.0.0. Support for the latest features in Optimizer Hub (formerly Cloud Native Compiler) 1.8.0. As Cloud Native Compiler expands its scope to offer more functionality than just offloading compilations, it is time to rebrand the offering to better reflect what it does. Starting with release 1.8, we are using the following naming: Optimizer Hub (was Cloud Native Compiler) - The name of the overall component that you install on your Kubernetes cluster. Cloud Native Compiler (was Compiler Service) - The feature that performs the compilation on Optimizer Hub. ReadyNow Orchestrator (was Profile Log Service) - The feature that records and serves ReadyNow profiles to JVMs. In Optimizer Hub 1.8, all major artifacts and command line switches use the updated branding. This includes, but is not limited to: Command-line JVM options to configure Cloud Native Compiler and ReadyNow Orchestrator. See Command Line Options. Helm repository locations, names, and parameter names: github.com/AzulSystems/opthub-helm-charts. REST API URLs. If you are using release 1.7 and earlier, all of the previous spellings of artifacts still work. Additionally, all of the pre-1.8 command-line arguments will continue to work for a period of one year from the release of 1.8. The command line option PreferContainerQuotaForVMInternalCPUCount has been set to true by default in order to make calculations of internal thread counts, as well as budgeting options, more clear in container environments. In container environments where both CPU shares and CPU quota are specified, such as with Kubernetes where these are commonly specified, the VM now uses quota to calculate compiler and GC thread counts. Prior to Azul Platform Prime 23.08, it was using half of quota for the calculation. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release.

This option allows the C2 compile threshold to be specified for individual methods. This option was introduced because some methods that are rarely called are still important and need to undergo regular optimization. This is set using -XX:CompileCommand in the following way: -XX:CompileCommand=\"option,<Class>::<method>,C2CompileThreshold=<threshold>\" The maximum supported code cache size has been increased to 1758 MB when AllocCodeCacheInLower2G is disabled using -XX:-AllocCodeCacheInLower2G. It is no longer necessary to LD_PRELOAD the libnmt_hooks.so library in order to use extended Native Memory Tracking (NMT). The libnmt_hooks.so library is now linked by default. Using Java Flight Recorder, you can now see exact JIT name for each stacktrace frame in Azul Mission Control in the Method Profiling tab. This uses the option JFRDistinguishJITTypes, which is set to true by default, and shows either C1, C2, or Falcon for each stacktrace frame.

What’s New Azul Zulu Prime 23.02.0.0 contains the General Availability (GA) release of Azul Prime Builds of OpenJDK 19 for x86_64 systems. Cloud Native Compiler (CNC) 1.6.1 client support. NativeMemoryTracking has been extended with further Falcon tracking support. To enable \"extended tracking,\" set LD_PRELOAD=$JAVA_HOME/etc/zing/lib/libnmt_hooks.so in addition to regular NMT flags which are described in Native Memory Tracking Options and in the Oracle documentation. Azul Zulu Prime 23.02.0.0 introduces new CPU budgeting features for the Falcon Tier 2 compiler. CPU Budgeting tells the Tier 2 compiler when to run and how many CPU threads to use, pre and post warmup. With these new features, it is possible to specify allocated threads as a percent, meaning the compiler and the running application can share resources, resulting in less pauses and more stability for the running application. Previously, only whole numbers of threads could be allocated. To enable these new features, use the argument -XX:+EnableTier2CompilerBudgeting. New Falcon CPU Budgeting features are listed in Command Line Options, CPU Budgeting Options A new command line option, AllocCodeCacheInLower2G has been introduced and is set to true by default. This option allocates code cache and related data structures at virtual address within 2 GB. To allow allocation to higher memory addresses, use -XX:-AllocCodeCacheinLower2G. This option is only available for x86_64 systems. Lower GC pauses with JVMTI - JVMTI tag map clearing has been moved outside of safepoint pause by default. This is set by the command line argument ConcurrentJVMTITagMapClearing and is set to true by default. Falcon improvement - Register allocation enhancement that improves code generation for derived pointers around GC safepoints. This allows derived pointers to rematerialize immediately before their use instead of after every safepoint. This is beneficial when a pointer is live across many statepoints but has few uses. Allocation publication barrier optimizations for Aarch64 in Falcon. Testing has yielded up to an 8.5% performance improvement from this optimization. The output format for -Xlog:safepoint has been changed to match OpenJDK for JDK13 and above. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release.

Cloud Native Compiler (CNC) 1.6 client support. You can now read and write ReadyNow profile logs to Cloud Native Compiler. This simplifies getting ReadyNow profile logs in and out of containers and other environments without persistent storage. Compile stashing has been disabled by default, even when using ReadyNow. Existing ReadyNow users that want to maintain the same compile stashing behavior as in earlier releases should ensure the -XX:+FalconUseCompileStashing flag is set. Users who wish to use compile stashing with the new Profile Log Service must ensure both +FalconUseCompileStashing and +CNCEnableRemoteCompiler flags are set. FalconContextReset is now set using ergonomics heuristic based on the number of Falcon compiler threads, unless specified explicitly. Falcon compiler threads reset the internal caches after every FalconContextReset number of compilations. This is a tradeoff between compilation speed and memory consumption. The more often the caches are reset, the less memory is consumed but more time is spent rebuilding the caches. Currently, the value of FalconContextReset is chosen as FalconContextResetFactor=<number of Falcon threads> nested between FalconContextResetLowerLimit and FalconContextResetUpperLimit.

Changes for containers regarding thread pool size calculation and number of available CPUs. With the October 2022 release of Java 11 and 17, the default calculation of available CPU cores will change, following JDK-8281181. Previously, the number of available CPU cores was in some situations calculated based on the lower bound defined in the environment. With the change in this release, the lower bound won’t be used anymore and the calculation will only be based on the upper limit of the environment. If in container-based systems no upper limit is defined, the total number of CPUs on the host machine is read as upper limit. A situation where a change will occur is, for example, a Kubernetes container where neither CPU requests nor CPU Limits are set, as previously the JVM would select only 1 CPU core as available in this situation while after the chance, it will select all available CPU cores of the environment which can lead to higher resource usage as thread pools of various open source frameworks are using this calculation for sizing. To verify if your systems are effect, check especially those where no upper limit is defined. In case you need to switch back to the previous calculation, add -XX:+UseContainerCpuShares to the Java command line. Other terms used in the context of CPU definitions are for lower bound \"CPU Requests\" or \"cgroups cpu.shares\", and for upper limit \"CPU Limits\" or \"cgroups cpu.cfs_quota_us\". When both quota and shares are specified for a cgroup and UseContainerCpuShares is true, the number of GC and compiler threads are derived based on a total processor count calculated as (quota+shares)/2. When UseContainerCpuShares is false the number is derived based on a total processor count calculated as (quota/2). To check the current setting, for example, to compare previous and current Java versions in your environment, use the following example to display the actual number of CPUs as seen by application code and run it inside your container environment: File AvailableCPUs.java:  public class AvailableCPUs {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"CPUs: \"\n            + Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());\n    }\n} To run it:  java -showversion AvailableCPUs.java Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. Resolved Issues ZVM-25268 - As a part of the PSU update, UseContainerCpuShares has been set to false (off) by default.

Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. 21.10.0.0 Release Notes PDF Release date: October 29, 2021 This CPU release is based on the following OpenJDK versions: Major Version OpenJDK Version 7 7u322 8 8u312 11 11.0.13 13 13.0.9 15 15.0.5 What’s New Includes all October 2021 CVE fixes. Azul Platform Prime 21.10.0.0 contains the October 2021 CPU release of OpenJDK. Azul Platform Prime 21.10.0.0 brings the associated JDK 7, JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK 13, and JDK 15 versions to October 2021 CPU security update levels. The peak heap occupancy target, used by heuristics to decide when to trigger a garbage collection, is now managed dynamically by default. The dynamic changes can be disabled by setting GPGCTargetPeakHeapOccupancyPercent to a desired value. Increased parallelism between collectors for the new generation and old generation. Helps reduce the peak duration for a new generation collection and reduce allocation delays during peak load. The number of concurrent GC threads is now changed dynamically when -Xms is set to the same value as -Xmx, or when Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) is installed. At JVM start a low number of concurrent GC threads is employed. If later during application uptime the GC Time Percent metric increases beyond a threshold, more GC threads are added to reduce the number of GC cycles. The limit for the total number of GC threads is 3/4 of the process' available CPU threads. As of this Prime version, the number of threads will never shrink later. To disable the dynamic handling, use the following on the command line: -XX:-UseDynamicNumberOfGCThreads If one of the following flags is set on the command line, the dynamic handling will also be disabled: -XX:GPGCThreads=N -XX:GenPauselessNewThreads=N -XX:GenPauselessOldThreads=N General performance improvements. More intrinsics from Java 17. Resolved Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-xxxx High CPU utilization by HeapCommit thread in some specific scenarios.

Calculations and methods around free memory calculation are not affected and will return the same results as before. That means for example Runtime.getRuntime.freeMemory() or difference calculation between attributes like \"used\" and \"total\" memory will also result in the same as in previous releases. See Recommended Heap Size for details. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. 21.05.1.0 Release Notes PDF Release date: July 12, 2021 This release corresponds to the following OpenJDK versions: Major Version OpenJDK Version 7 7u302 8 8u292 11 11.0.11+9 13 13.0.7+5 15 15.0.3+3 What’s New A fix for bug ZVM-20496 which turns opt-boxing-rewrite-loads off by default to avoid miscompiles in certain code patterns. Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues associated with this release. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. 21.05.0.0 Release Notes PDF Release date: May 31, 2021 This release corresponds to the following OpenJDK versions: Major Version OpenJDK Version 7 7u302 8 8u292 11 11.0.11+9 13 13.0.7+5 15 15.0.3+3 What’s New Non-ZST Heap Elasticity introduced. See Recommended Heap Size for details. When heap elasticity is enabled, the Garbage Collector tries to minimize the memory footprint, keeping it between the user- defined range of -Xms and -Xmx. At the same time, the CPU usage of the Garbage Collector is monitored and the memory minimizing goal relaxed in case the CPU usage increases too much. Heap Elasticity is not available when Azul Zulu System Tools (ZST) is installed. Azul Platform Prime 21.05.0.0 makes the OpenJDK C1 OSR the default OSR for the Falcon compiler. The C1 OSR takes much less time and CPU resources to fully optimize your code to steady-state performance. Stream Builds (previously known as Feature Releases) are now free for use in development and evaluation. As such, the builds no longer check for an evaluation license. Latency improvement for applications with frequent Unsafe.get() and put() calls. Fixed heap dump compatibility issue that prevented opening Azul Zulu Prime head dumps in IntelliJIdea. Enabled jcmd ManagementAgent command option support. Resolved Issues There are no resolved issues associated with this release. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. 21.04.0.0 Release Notes PDF Release date: April 30, 2021 This CPU and PSU release is based on the following OpenJDK versions: Major Version OpenJDK Version 7 7u302 8 8u292 11 11.0.11+9 13 13.0.7+5 15 15.0.3+3 What’s New April 2021 CPU and PSU fixes. Quicker acquisition of transparent huge pages on Ubuntu, Amazon Linux or similar Linux systems with kernel 4.19.7 or newer in non-ZST mode.

This allows the Falcon compiler to assign ranks, hot, warm, or cold, to methods in order to prioritize system resources to methods depending on their hotness. The value of compilation ranking is that compiler activity is optimized later in an application run, not only reducing system load and freeing up resources for the running application but also reducing application outliers. For more information on compilation ranks, see Analyzing and Tuning Warmup. For newly added options, see Command Line Options. As of Azul Platform Prime 23.08.0.0, ZVision and ZVRobot components have been deprecated and are no longer actively developed. While we still support these components, we encourage users to switch to Java Flight Recorder, as ZVision and ZVRobot are planned for End-of-Life with Azul Platform Prime 24.02.0.0. Support for the latest features in Optimizer Hub (formerly Cloud Native Compiler) 1.8.0. As Cloud Native Compiler expands its scope to offer more functionality than just offloading compilations, it is time to rebrand the offering to better reflect what it does. Starting with release 1.8, we are using the following naming: Optimizer Hub (was Cloud Native Compiler) - The name of the overall component that you install on your Kubernetes cluster. Cloud Native Compiler (was Compiler Service) - The feature that performs the compilation on Optimizer Hub. ReadyNow Orchestrator (was Profile Log Service) - The feature that records and serves ReadyNow profiles to JVMs. In Optimizer Hub 1.8, all major artifacts and command line switches use the updated branding. This includes, but is not limited to: Command-line JVM options to configure Cloud Native Compiler and ReadyNow Orchestrator. See Command Line Options. Helm repository locations, names, and parameter names: github.com/AzulSystems/opthub-helm-charts. REST API URLs. If you are using release 1.7 and earlier, all of the previous spellings of artifacts still work. Additionally, all of the pre-1.8 command-line arguments will continue to work for a period of one year from the release of 1.8. The command line option PreferContainerQuotaForVMInternalCPUCount has been set to true by default in order to make calculations of internal thread counts, as well as budgeting options, more clear in container environments. In container environments where both CPU shares and CPU quota are specified, such as with Kubernetes where these are commonly specified, the VM now uses quota to calculate compiler and GC thread counts. Prior to Azul Platform Prime 23.08, it was using half of quota for the calculation. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. Resolved Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-28301 Fix java_lang_String::hash_code ZVM-28262 Remove default RSS cap for ProfileLogIn ZVM-28242 JFR profiler does not collect stack traces ZVM-28144 Exhausting java heap during early VM initialization causes a hang ZVM-28121 JFR is not collecting jdk.ExecutionSample events on ARM ZVM-27536 Enable per-thread CPU utilisation data collection in SelfDiagnosticRunLevel=3"

This is set using -XX:CompileCommand in the following way: -XX:CompileCommand=\"option,<Class>::<method>,C2CompileThreshold=<threshold>\" The maximum supported code cache size has been increased to 1758 MB when AllocCodeCacheInLower2G is disabled using -XX:-AllocCodeCacheInLower2G. It is no longer necessary to LD_PRELOAD the libnmt_hooks.so library in order to use extended Native Memory Tracking (NMT). The libnmt_hooks.so library is now linked by default. Using Java Flight Recorder, you can now see exact JIT name for each stacktrace frame in Azul Mission Control in the Method Profiling tab. This uses the option JFRDistinguishJITTypes, which is set to true by default, and shows either C1, C2, or Falcon for each stacktrace frame. With JFRDistinguishJITTypes set to false, it shows JIT compiled. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release.

GC Log Analyzer 2 is included in Azul Zulu Prime packages and can be found at <installdir>/etc/GCLogAnalyzer2.jar. The latest version of GC Log Analyzer 2 is also available for download at https://docs.azul.com/prime/GC-Log-Analyzer. What’s New Azul Zulu Prime 23.02.0.0 contains the General Availability (GA) release of Azul Prime Builds of OpenJDK 19 for x86_64 systems. Cloud Native Compiler (CNC) 1.6.1 client support. NativeMemoryTracking has been extended with further Falcon tracking support. To enable \"extended tracking,\" set LD_PRELOAD=$JAVA_HOME/etc/zing/lib/libnmt_hooks.so in addition to regular NMT flags which are described in Native Memory Tracking Options and in the Oracle documentation. Azul Zulu Prime 23.02.0.0 introduces new CPU budgeting features for the Falcon Tier 2 compiler. CPU Budgeting tells the Tier 2 compiler when to run and how many CPU threads to use, pre and post warmup. With these new features, it is possible to specify allocated threads as a percent, meaning the compiler and the running application can share resources, resulting in less pauses and more stability for the running application. Previously, only whole numbers of threads could be allocated. To enable these new features, use the argument -XX:+EnableTier2CompilerBudgeting. New Falcon CPU Budgeting features are listed in Command Line Options, CPU Budgeting Options A new command line option, AllocCodeCacheInLower2G has been introduced and is set to true by default. This option allocates code cache and related data structures at virtual address within 2 GB. To allow allocation to higher memory addresses, use -XX:-AllocCodeCacheinLower2G. This option is only available for x86_64 systems. Lower GC pauses with JVMTI - JVMTI tag map clearing has been moved outside of safepoint pause by default. This is set by the command line argument ConcurrentJVMTITagMapClearing and is set to true by default. Falcon improvement - Register allocation enhancement that improves code generation for derived pointers around GC safepoints. This allows derived pointers to rematerialize immediately before their use instead of after every safepoint. This is beneficial when a pointer is live across many statepoints but has few uses. Allocation publication barrier optimizations for Aarch64 in Falcon. Testing has yielded up to an 8.5% performance improvement from this optimization. The output format for -Xlog:safepoint has been changed to match OpenJDK for JDK13 and above. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release.

GC Log Analyzer 2 is included in Azul Zulu Prime packages and can be found at <installdir>/etc/GCLogAnalyzer2.jar. The latest version of GC Log Analyzer 2 is also available for download at https://docs.azul.com/prime/GC-Log-Analyzer. What’s New January 2023 CPU and PSU release security fixes. Cloud Native Compiler (CNC) 1.6 client support. You can now read and write ReadyNow profile logs to Cloud Native Compiler. This simplifies getting ReadyNow profile logs in and out of containers and other environments without persistent storage. Compile stashing has been disabled by default, even when using ReadyNow. Existing ReadyNow users that want to maintain the same compile stashing behavior as in earlier releases should ensure the -XX:+FalconUseCompileStashing flag is set. Users who wish to use compile stashing with the new Profile Log Service must ensure both +FalconUseCompileStashing and +CNCEnableRemoteCompiler flags are set. FalconContextReset is now set using ergonomics heuristic based on the number of Falcon compiler threads, unless specified explicitly. Falcon compiler threads reset the internal caches after every FalconContextReset number of compilations. This is a tradeoff between compilation speed and memory consumption. The more often the caches are reset, the less memory is consumed but more time is spent rebuilding the caches. Currently, the value of FalconContextReset is chosen as FalconContextResetFactor=<number of Falcon threads> nested between FalconContextResetLowerLimit and FalconContextResetUpperLimit.

Changes for containers regarding thread pool size calculation and number of available CPUs. With the October 2022 release of Java 11 and 17, the default calculation of available CPU cores will change, following JDK-8281181. Previously, the number of available CPU cores was in some situations calculated based on the lower bound defined in the environment. With the change in this release, the lower bound won’t be used anymore and the calculation will only be based on the upper limit of the environment. If in container-based systems no upper limit is defined, the total number of CPUs on the host machine is read as upper limit. A situation where a change will occur is, for example, a Kubernetes container where neither CPU requests nor CPU Limits are set, as previously the JVM would select only 1 CPU core as available in this situation while after the chance, it will select all available CPU cores of the environment which can lead to higher resource usage as thread pools of various open source frameworks are using this calculation for sizing. To verify if your systems are effect, check especially those where no upper limit is defined. In case you need to switch back to the previous calculation, add -XX:+UseContainerCpuShares to the Java command line. Other terms used in the context of CPU definitions are for lower bound \"CPU Requests\" or \"cgroups cpu.shares\", and for upper limit \"CPU Limits\" or \"cgroups cpu.cfs_quota_us\". When both quota and shares are specified for a cgroup and UseContainerCpuShares is true, the number of GC and compiler threads are derived based on a total processor count calculated as (quota+shares)/2. When UseContainerCpuShares is false the number is derived based on a total processor count calculated as (quota/2). To check the current setting, for example, to compare previous and current Java versions in your environment, use the following example to display the actual number of CPUs as seen by application code and run it inside your container environment: File AvailableCPUs.java:  public class AvailableCPUs {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"CPUs: \"\n            + Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());\n    }\n} To run it:  java -showversion AvailableCPUs.java Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release. Resolved Issues ZVM-25268 - As a part of the PSU update, UseContainerCpuShares has been set to false (off) by default. ZVM-22642 - The GC log now reports data from remote compilations which can be viewed in GC Log Analyzer."

Azul Platform Prime 21.10.0.0 contains the October 2021 CPU release of OpenJDK. Azul Platform Prime 21.10.0.0 brings the associated JDK 7, JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK 13, and JDK 15 versions to October 2021 CPU security update levels. The peak heap occupancy target, used by heuristics to decide when to trigger a garbage collection, is now managed dynamically by default. The dynamic changes can be disabled by setting GPGCTargetPeakHeapOccupancyPercent to a desired value. Increased parallelism between collectors for the new generation and old generation. Helps reduce the peak duration for a new generation collection and reduce allocation delays during peak load. The number of concurrent GC threads is now changed dynamically when -Xms is set to the same value as -Xmx, or when Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) is installed. At JVM start a low number of concurrent GC threads is employed. If later during application uptime the GC Time Percent metric increases beyond a threshold, more GC threads are added to reduce the number of GC cycles. The limit for the total number of GC threads is 3/4 of the process' available CPU threads. As of this Prime version, the number of threads will never shrink later. To disable the dynamic handling, use the following on the command line: -XX:-UseDynamicNumberOfGCThreads If one of the following flags is set on the command line, the dynamic handling will also be disabled: -XX:GPGCThreads=N -XX:GenPauselessNewThreads=N -XX:GenPauselessOldThreads=N General performance improvements. More intrinsics from Java 17. Resolved Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-xxxx High CPU utilization by HeapCommit thread in some specific scenarios. This only applies when -Xms isn’t set or set to less than -Xmx. ZVM-xxxx Fixes crash on JVM start on Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish) and CentOS 9 Stream (beta). Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release."

Improved memory allocation handling in Heap Elasticity mode to avoid exceeding the container/cgroups memory limit. Fixed many issues with Async Profiling. Various performance improvements with Falcon compiler: Fixed extra spills causing performance penalties by supporting live gc values on registers for calls which can throw exceptions Improved performance of applications that frequently use Unsafe.allocateInstance. Implemented nested locks elimination optimization for multiple nested locks on a given object under the condition that the nested lock state is not inspected. Resolved Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-19710 Profiling with cpu/wall events yeilds unusable results ZVM-20081 Startup failure when specifying Xms larger than 25% of RAM, when -XX:+GPGCNoZSTHeapElasticity is specified and Xmx is not specified. ZVM-19972 JVM memory metrics like Runtime.getRuntime.totalMemory() and Runtime.getRuntime.maxMemory() and related like java.lang.management.MemoryMXBean now include JVM-internal memory usage and will show a few MBytes larger numbers now. Calculations and methods around free memory calculation are not affected and will return the same results as before. That means for example Runtime.getRuntime.freeMemory() or difference calculation between attributes like \"used\" and \"total\" memory will also result in the same as in previous releases. See Recommended Heap Size for details. Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release."

Heap Elasticity is not available when Azul Zulu System Tools (ZST) is installed. Azul Platform Prime 21.05.0.0 makes the OpenJDK C1 OSR the default OSR for the Falcon compiler. The C1 OSR takes much less time and CPU resources to fully optimize your code to steady-state performance. Stream Builds (previously known as Feature Releases) are now free for use in development and evaluation. As such, the builds no longer check for an evaluation license. Latency improvement for applications with frequent Unsafe.get() and put() calls. Fixed heap dump compatibility issue that prevented opening Azul Zulu Prime head dumps in IntelliJIdea.

For Azul Zulu Prime JVM JDK 11, this improvement was made in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0. KestrelC2 is a C2 implementation introduced to Azul Zulu Prime JVM in 2020. It is based on a lightweight use of the LLVM backend and typically produces faster code than UseSeaOfNodesC2 while keeping compilation effort at similar levels. UseKestrelC2 generally exhibits a significantly lower compilation-time CPU consumption compared to Falcon. See Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM Command-Line Options for -XX:[+/-]UseKestrelC2 and -XX:[+/-]UseSeaOfNodesC2 command-line options and details. The default JIT compiler in Azul Zulu Prime JVM is the high-performance Falcon introduced in 2017. New Experimental Features Azul Zulu Prime JVM 21.01.0.0 includes optional experimental support for interaction with connected runtime services through an emerging protocol in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 11 and Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8. These experimental capabilities are enabled by the -XX:+UseCRS command-line option and turned off by default. Being an experimental Azul Zulu Prime JVM option, it must be unlocked by preceding -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions. Performance Improvement Azul Zulu Prime JVM 21.01.0.0 introduces an improved escape analysis for arrays in the Falcon compiler. The improvement includes an optimization for array reallocation pattern (e.g., java.util.Arrays.copyOf) to avoid redundant copying. Notably, this optimization improves the performance of string concatenation using the StringBuilder class by the elimination of excessive reallocations of the underlying StringBuilder buffer. Support for EdDSA Signature Algorithm Azul Zulu Prime JVM 21.01.0.0 introduces the OpenEdDSA provider which can be used for cryptographic signatures using the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8 with no application or code changes. See JEP 339: Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) for details. The OpenEdDSA public API is provided in the org.openeddsa.java.security.interfaces and org.openeddsa.java.security.spec packages. To enable the OpenEdDSA provider, do either of the following: configure the Java Runtime Environment for the OpenEdDSA provider by adding the entry below to the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security file  security.provider.10=org.openeddsa.security.OpenEdDSA add the OpenEdDSA provider directly to your code  // Add OpenEdDSA provider\njava.security.Security.addProvider(new org.openeddsa.security.OpenEdDSA()); Resolved Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-18362 A compiler crash due to incorrect transformation of Compare And Swap on an unescaped object.

UseKestrelC2 generally exhibits a significantly lower compilation-time CPU consumption compared to Falcon. See Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM Command-Line Options for -XX:[+/-]UseKestrelC2 and -XX:[+/-]UseSeaOfNodesC2 command-line options and details. The default JIT compiler in Azul Zulu Prime JVM is the high-performance Falcon introduced in 2017. New Experimental Features Azul Zulu Prime JVM 21.01.0.0 includes optional experimental support for interaction with connected runtime services through an emerging protocol in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 11 and Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8. These experimental capabilities are enabled by the -XX:+UseCRS command-line option and turned off by default. Being an experimental Azul Zulu Prime JVM option, it must be unlocked by preceding -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions. Performance Improvement Azul Zulu Prime JVM 21.01.0.0 introduces an improved escape analysis for arrays in the Falcon compiler. The improvement includes an optimization for array reallocation pattern (e.g., java.util.Arrays.copyOf) to avoid redundant copying. Notably, this optimization improves the performance of string concatenation using the StringBuilder class by the elimination of excessive reallocations of the underlying StringBuilder buffer. Support for EdDSA Signature Algorithm Azul Zulu Prime JVM 21.01.0.0 introduces the OpenEdDSA provider which can be used for cryptographic signatures using the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8 with no application or code changes. See JEP 339: Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) for details. The OpenEdDSA public API is provided in the org.openeddsa.java.security.interfaces and org.openeddsa.java.security.spec packages. To enable the OpenEdDSA provider, do either of the following: configure the Java Runtime Environment for the OpenEdDSA provider by adding the entry below to the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security file  security.provider.10=org.openeddsa.security.OpenEdDSA add the OpenEdDSA provider directly to your code  // Add OpenEdDSA provider\njava.security.Security.addProvider(new org.openeddsa.security.OpenEdDSA());"

  "content" : "20.04.0.0 Release Notes PDF Release date: April 30, 2020 This release corresponds to the following OpenJDK versions: Major Version OpenJDK Version 7 7u262 8 8u252 11 11.0.7+10 What’s New The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0 contains April 2020 critical patch update (CPU) security and critical bug fixes and brings the associated JDK 7, JDK 8, and JDK 11 versions to April 2020 CPU security update levels. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0 incorporates additional non-security changes associated with the April PSU 2020 OpenJDK 8u252 and OpenJDK 11.0.7 release contents. Starting with Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0, the -XX:+UseC2 option can use one of two separate implementations of C2 JIT compilation: a traditional UseSeaOfNodesC2 mode and a new UseKestrelC2 mode. The new mode is selected with +UseKestrelC2 which is on by default for Azul Zulu Prime JVM 11 and off by default for Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8 and Azul Zulu Prime JVM 7. This mode enables a C2 implementation introduced to Azul Zulu Prime JVM in 2020. It is based on a lightweight use of the LLVM backend and typically produces faster code than UseSeaOfNodesC2 while keeping compilation effort at similar levels. UseKestrelC2 generally exhibits a significantly lower compilation-time CPU consumption compared to Falcon. The old mode is selected with +UseSeaOfNodesC2 which is off by default in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 11 and on by default for Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8 and Azul Zulu Prime JVM 7. See Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM Command-Line Options for UseKestrelC2 and UseSeaOfNodesC2 command-line options and details. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0 introduces a compilation time improvement. The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0 introduces an increased maximum Java heap size from 1 TB to 2.5 TB in the default non-ZST mode. The maximum Java heap size for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Virtual Machine with ZST is 20 TB. In Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0, a new Java Flight Recorder functionality allows you to collect profiling data about applications that use JNI invocations. The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0 includes optimizations targeted at reducing JNI transition costs. The cost of a native call from Java was reduced, and the implementation of the accessor functions used to retrieve fields of Java objects from native code was also improved. Most applications will not be affected, but applications with many native transitions (such as a socket or file IO) may see the marked improvement. See Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM Command-Line Options for UseFastJNIAccessors, UseMembar, and UseThreadStateNativeWrapperProtocol command-line options and details. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04.0.0 excludes debug symbols embedded in libjvm.so, which reduces the filesystem footprint of a Azul Zulu Prime JVM installation by 280 MB. Contact [email protected] if you need to install debug symbols for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Resolved Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-15020 Illegal memcpy generated through the optimizer. ZVM-14815 getPercentJavaHeapOccupiedAfterCollection() returns 0. ZVM-10128 Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() returns an incorrect value when affinity is set. Known Issues Issue ID Description ZVM-14636 Heap dumps and JVMTI object tagging are not supported with UseEpsilonGC."

  "content" : "What’s New January 2020 CPU Release. InZVM20.01.0.0, -XX:+FalconCompensateForIntelMCUForErratumSKX102 is an off-by-default option and introduces a nop padding based mitigation for performance regressions seen on some systems following Intel’s microcode updates in response to errata SKX102. This option is expected to become the default in a future Zing release. If enabled, nop padding will be used to align affected branches on systems with the microcode update applied. For testing purposes, the flag -XX:+ForceFalconCompensateForIntelMCUForErratumSKX102 is also provided. This can be used to force the generation of nop padded code on unaffected systems for performance validation."

October 2022 PSU release security fixes Important information regarding Java in containers (Docker, Kubernetes, and related) about automatic thread pool size calculation and number of CPUs available to the application: While in the general October 2022 release of Java 11 and 17, the default calculation of available CPU cores has changed in container environments following JDK-8281181, this change wasn’t made in the Azul Platform Prime stable release 22.08.200.0 to allow seamless transition from previous stable versions. That means, Azul Platform Prime 22.08 differs in this aspect from current OpenJDK. In practical use, this difference will only affect those situations where a new migration from OpenJDK to Prime 22.08 is started. If you notice your application performance being affected during such a transition from OpenJDK to Prime 22.08 add -XX:-UseContainerCpuShares to the Java command line to switch Azul Platform Prime to the same new calculation method as OpenJDK. To check your environment in general about this change, independent of whether it is running on OpenJDK or Azul Platform Prime, run the following command inside your container to display the actual result of the available CPU number calculation: Save the following code to file AvailableCPUs.java:  public class AvailableCPUs {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        System.out.println(\"CPUs: \"\n            + Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());\n    }\n} Run it:  java -showversion AvailableCPUs.java Known Issues There are no new issues to report in this release.

At this time, Azul is not aware of any vulnerability in ZVision itself. For this reason, ZVision is still available for download for Azul Platform Prime subscribers at https://ftp.azul.com/releases/Zing/ZVision/ZVTools.zip It is no longer necessary to LD_PRELOAD the libnmt_hooks.so library in order to use extended Native Memory Tracking (NMT). The libnmt_hooks.so library is now linked by default. July 2023 CPU and PSU release security fixes."

  "content" : "Note This page lists new features in each release of Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) prior to 20.02.1.0. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.102.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.102.0 contains -XX:+FalconCompensateForIntelMCUForErratumSKX102 which is an off-by-default option and introduces a nop padding based mitigation for performance regressions seen on some systems following Intel’s microcode updates in response to errata SKX102. This option is expected to become the default in a future Azul Zulu Prime JVM release. If enabled, nop padding will be used to align affected branches on systems with the microcode update applied. For testing purposes, the flag -XX:+ForceFalconCompensateForIntelMCUForErratumSKX102 is also provided. This can be used to force the generation of nop padded code on unaffected systems for performance validation. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.101.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.101.0 is a critical patch update (CPU) release that contains security and critical bug fixes only. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.101.0 is based on Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.100.0 and Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0 and brings the associated JDK 7, JDK 8, and JDK 11 versions to January 2020 CPU security update levels. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0 introduces additional non-security changes associated with the PSU 2019 OpenJDK 8u232 and OpenJDK 11.0.5 release contents. The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0 provides further improved throughput and latency characteristics with heaps less than or equal to 1 GB. The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0 provides enhanced escape analysis and a few other improvements in the Falcon JIT compiler, which may decrease the allocation rate and deliver higher performance on some workloads. The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0 enhances the improvements of ReadyNow and Compile Stashing started in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.10.0.0, which now dramatically reduces CPU consumption for JIT compilation on many workloads.. Starting with Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.12.0.0, Compile Stashing is not enabled by default with the -XX:ProfileLogOut command-line option. Compile Stashing is still enabled by default only in combination with the -XX:ProfileLogIn command-line option. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 introduces an option to write live memory objects into Azul Zulu Prime JVM flight recordings for troubleshooting memory leaks. Use the JFRDescribeLiveSetPercentage command-line option to tune the percentage amount of a live set to be described. Due to providing better input from ReadyNow to Falcon and enabling Falcon to do better optimizations, Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 closes or significantly shortens a gap between ReadyNow and default Azul Zulu Prime JVM final throughputs in rare cases when the gap is observed. Note that in some cases doing better optimizations may lead to an increase in CPU consumption or startup time. In such cases, the new FalconOptimizationLevel command-line option can be used to lower the aggressiveness of optimizations. See Falcon Compiler Options for details. Starting with Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.08.0.0, Azul Zulu Prime JVM supports a heap size of 512 MB. The release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 adds improved Azul Zulu Prime JVM performance for heaps of less than 2 GB. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 significantly reduces CPU usage due to a new compilation policy and improvements in the Falcon compiler. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 features updated Azul Zulu Prime JVM MXBeans javadoc. In Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 the default values for CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace, CodeCacheOopTableSize and ReservedCodeCacheSize command-line options are changed to allow more space for objects in the Java heap with small heaps. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 introduces new Thread Local Allocation Buffer (TLAB) command-line options to resize TLABs and manage allocation of objects in TLABs. In Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0, the default value of the AlignArrayStart command-line option is changed to true. In Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0, the default value of the HserrRawCodeWindowSize command-line option is changed to 512. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.09.0.0 introduces a new MaxRAMPercentage command-line option for adjusting the maximum heap size based on the configured cgroup memory limit. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.08.0.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.08.0.0 incorporates additional non-security changes associated with the PSU 2019 OpenJDK 8u222 and OpenJDK 11.0.4 release contents. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.08.0.0 introduces the OpenJSSE TLS 1.3 JSSE provider which can be used to enable TLS 1.3 support with no application or code changes. Use the -XX:+UseOpenJSSE command-line option to enable TLS 1.3 support. A new PrintGCHSLines command-line option for controling additional system information lines. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07.0.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07.0.0 brings the associated JDK 7, JDK 8, and JDK 11 versions to July 2019 CPU security update levels. Starting with Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07.0.0 the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Virtual Machine installs without the Azul Zulu Prime JVM System Tools component dependencies by default. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07.0.0 introduces a new FalconOptimizationLevel command-line option for controling the level of compiling optimization. Enhancements for the ReadyNow performance tuning tool. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.05.100.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.05.100.0 brings the associated JDK 7, JDK 8, and JDK 11 versions to July 2019 CPU security update levels. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.05.0.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.05.0.0 incorporates additional non-security changes associated with the April 2019 OpenJDK 8u212 and OpenJDK 11.0.3 release contents. Azul Zulu Prime JVM JDK 8 supports JEP 328. The Java Flight Recorder feature records information about Azul Zulu Prime JVM VM and its environment while it is running. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.03.0.0 The GPGCPausePreventionMemory command-line option is introduced to restrict pause prevention memory. The ProfilePreMainTier2CompilerThreads, and ProfileWorkerThreads command-line options are added. The default value of ProfileStartupLimitInSeconds, is changed to 60. The default value of the FalconUseAVX command-line option is changed to 2. The default value of the ProfileStartupLimitInSeconds command-line option is changed to 60. The default value of the ResetSignalMaskAtLaunch command-line option is changed to true. The default value of the RunVMErrorOnUnhandledSignals command-line option is changed to true. Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.02.0.0 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.02.0.0 applies fixes reflecting January 2019 OpenJDK 7u211, OpenJDK 8u201, OpenJDK 8u202, and OpenJDK 11.0.2 changes.

Previously, non-product options were also shown. 12521 18.01.0.0 Backport of JDK-8063086: Math.pow yields different results upon repeated calls. 12629 18.01.0.0 The application threads waits to be notified by the collector until the end of next new collection for allocations when they hit allocation failure. The use of the newly introduced -XX:GPGCMutatorSleepBeforeAllocRetryMS option makes the delayed to respond to the freed pages earlier and helps in reducing the length of allocation delays seen by the application threads. 12428 17.12.1.0 Expressions with nested Math.pow() fail with the result Not-a-Number error for some floating point values. 12767 17.12.1.0 Comodo root Certificate Authority is missing in cacerts files. 8606 17.12.0.0 Zing crashes if its command line contains only -Xms but no -Xmx, and -Xms is larger than default max heap size (currently 1G). The fix ensures no more such crashes happen. 11772 17.12.0.0 Zing tools do not work with an OEM license because the entry point JAR file is loaded by bootstrap. 12010 17.11.1.0 ZVM garbage collector related process abort at C [libjvm.so+0x29672c] GPGC_Layout::addr_to_BasePageForSpace. 12461 17.11.1.0 ZVM Falcon compiler related process abort at C [libjvm.so+0x58dca8] DolphinParser::reify_abstract_state. 12492 17.11.1.0 Interpreter or other runtime ZVM abort following a deoptimization of Falcon compiled code and an attempt to recompile and run the newly compiled method. Internal root cause is Falcon compiler’s reuse of OopTable indices. 8341 17.11.0.0 ZVM will not start if -Xmx and -Xms are both specified and have values that are odd numbers. 11143 17.11.0.0 Unexpected use of the System.nanoTime() method in the Falcon compiler. 11850 17.11.0.0 ZVM crashed in guarantee(secondary_supers()) failed: Unitialized secondary supers during typecheck. 11896 17.11.0.0 Backport of JDK-6512830: Error: assert(tag_at(which).is_unresolved_klass(), \"Corrupted constant pool\"). 12131 17.11.0.0 Backport JDK-8075484: SocketInputStream.socketRead0 can hang even with soTimeout set. 12132 17.11.0.0 Backport JDK-8178536: OOM ERRORS + SERVICE-THREAD TAKES A PROCESSOR TO 100%. 10064 17.10.0.0 ZVM crashed due to incorrect deoptimization in clone intrinsic implementation. 11612 17.06.2.0 A bug in a function call in the optimized intrinsic code for AES. 10043 17.06.0.0 Using the -usedatex command-line option together with the Set Time Range option of the GC Log Analyser tool resulted in empty graphs. 10298 17.06.0.0 INVOKEINTERFACE called on the java.lang.Object method in ASM-generated byte code fails after several iterations. 10428 17.06.0.0 The use of the date/time X-axis of the GC Log Analyser tool encounters error caused by duplicate elapsed times for items in a dataset. 10440 17.06.0.0 Warning counters differ in jstat -profile and -profileerrors output of the ReadyNow tool. 10499 17.03.3.0 Internal Error at ciObject.hpp: compiler_assert(is_instance()) failed: bad cast : 10353 17.03.3.0 Crash due to an unexpected error detected by Java Runtime Environment: guarantee(lbl == _ex_labels→at(idx)) failed: single handler bci given 2 different rel_pc mappings. 10334 17.03.3.0 Scala 2.12 fails with bytecode error. 10174 17.03.3.0 Crash with the error message: LLVM fatal error: Unable to allocate section memory! 10297 17.03.2.0 Crash with the following problematic frame: J (C2) com.mchange.v2.c3p0.impl.NewPooledConnection.carefulCheckHoldability(Ljava/sql/Connection;)I 9970 17.03.2.0 Zing crashes with the following error: LLVM fatal error: Do not know how to split the result of this operator! 10156 17.03.1.0 Too many recompilations on a particular method results in the same being marked \"do not-compile any longer\". 4702 17.03.0.0 Use of the OnOutOfMemoryError flag triggers a crash. 8298 16.12.3.0 New generation relocation aborts can lead to Java heap live set growth. This affects ZVM versions 16.01.0.0 through ZVM 16.12.2. 9463 16.12.3.0 Frequent New GC cycles can lead to Java heap live set growth. When the New GC intercycle time is lower than the promotion threshold, objects can be retained in the new generation causing a growth in the live set. This affects ZVM versions 15.09.0.0 through ZVM 16.12.2. 7911 16.12.2.0 Crash with the following problematic frame: C [libjvm.so+0x38d1c2] jvmti_GetTime+0x62. 9050 16.12.2.0 On some RHEL 5 systems, where the command: find /sys/devices/system/cpu -name thread_siblings produces a list of files that is in descending numerical order by a CPU directory name, ThreadOpt will exit with an IndexOutOfBoundsException. 9086 16.12.1.0 Applications can hang when ZVM runs with the Falcon compiler. 8655 16.12.0.0 Crash due to usage of the +UseFastJNIAccessors option. The option has not been implemented yet. To avoid crashing the option marked as unchangeable. 6520 16.12.0.0 No timestamp generated with the +PrintGCDetails option alone on command line causes gcLogAnalyser \"unable to read\". 8561 16.10.1.0 ZVM can exit due to code cache exhaustion by Java monitors. Applications which make heavy use of Java monitors either due to lock contention or wait/notify mechanisms, can potentially see a high footprint related to monitors in the code cache. 8224 16.10.0.0 A stray C2 thread is running at 100% CPU without making any forward progress. 8071 16.07.1.0 C-Heap Leak happens in raw-monitor creation. RawMonitors are leaking semaphore objects which are eagerly created during VMLock creation. The fix includes releasing sem_t objects and calling sem_destroy. 7756 16.07.1.0 ZVM crashes with the following problematic frame: [libjvm.so+0x318ab3] java_lang_Class::as_klassOop(oopDesc*)+0x23. 2820 16.07.1.0 Nashorn benchmark stalls after encountering data error processing profile log error (error: 101) while running Nashorn benchmarks with ReadyNow enabled. The fix adds supports for dealing with Nashorn and eliminates this issue. 4758 16.07.0.0 Additional control flags introduced to prevent startup crashes due to usage of ProfileLogIn. Following are those control flags: * ProfileUsePersistedInstructionData * ProfileProactivelyCompileC1 * ProfileProactivelyCompileC2 4811 16.07.0.0 jstat -profile (and -profileerrors) returned unresolved symbols when ProfileLogIn is not specified. The fix now ensures that zeros will be printed instead of unresolved symbols. 5803 16.07.0.0 Wrong class was being loaded only when using the ProfileLogIn profile. The fix implements safe mode for ReadyNow to avoid an improper speculative load that might produce a misleading and worrisome report. 6300 16.07.0.0 Removed non-relevant data from graphs (Old Gen Collector: App Threads Delay and Pages Promoted). 6778 16.07.0.0 ReadyNow failed to recognize the generated Lambda classes as generated. The fix implements safe mode for ReadyNow to use when ReadyNow’s generated class heuristics do not work for a class generator. 7422 16.07.0.0 Enabling ProfileLiveObjects seems to increase GC cycle durations significantly. The fix implements an improved hash function along with few other optimizations resulting in reduced GC cycle durations. 7434 16.07.0.0 The default value of MlockLevel has been changed to 1 from 0: * MlockLevel=0 – do not attempt any mlocks * MLockLevel=1 – quietly attempt to mlock libjvm.so 7451 16.07.0.0 Crash with the following problematic frame: StubRoutines::find_SEGV_continuation_address. 7654 16.07.0.0, 16.01.7.0 Resolving an orphaned FinalLive objects through JNI weak handle during ConcurrentRefProcessing could lead to the following crash: guarantee(loop_count < size) failed: should have found the relocation record 7422 16.01.7.0 Enabling ProfileLiveObjects seems to increase GC cycle durations significantly. The fix implements an improved hash function along with few other optimizations resulting in reduced GC cycle durations. 5547 16.01.7.0 When running on some Cassandrs nodes, the following enexpected error has been detected: guarantee(GPGC_Marks::is_any_marked_strong_live(obj)) failed: NewGen oop at final clear not strong live 6907 16.01.6.0 aCrash due to an internal error: guarantee(loop_count < size) failed: should have found the relocation record The fix ensures that a class of a Java object is treated as StrongLive even if that object is itself only FinalLive. This guarantees that the classes of FinalLive objects cannot be orphaned before the StrongLive mark-through of FinalLive referents, and will ensure their relocation. 6058, 6108 16.01.5.0 High GC pauses due to JVM code being paged out. The fix introduces a new command-line option MlockLevel, which can be tuned. If the flag is set without a value, the default ensures no page JVM code page-outs. The option specifies one of four mlock strategies: . Do not attempt any mlock (EARLY) . mlock libjvm.so text region (LATE) . mlockall (EARLY) . mlockall (LATE) Example: use -XX:+MlockLevel=1001 to attempt strategy 1 while reporting verbosely. This option should be used only with guidance of Azul Support. 6258 16.01.5.0 A random error code is being returned from the JDK method: java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences.lockFile0(). 6436 16.01.5.0 In ZVision, clicking on the tty_lock entry in zvision → threads → contention causes a crash. 6631 16.01.5.0 +MinimizeJNICriticalLock causes an IllegalArgumentException in java.util.zip.Deflater.deflate. 6898 16.01.5.0 Nginx-Clojure does not work with Zing because the linker option -Wl,-soname,libjvm.so has not been passed and the libjvm.so library cannot be found. 7071 16.01.5.0 Zing VM can crash at very early stages due to lack of system resources. 6542 16.01.3.0 Applications that use large chunks(>100s of MBs) of DirectByteBuffer could potentially face high TTSP times in New/OldGC pause3 because of the deallocation of these buffers. 6791 16.01.3.0 NullPointerException caused by wrong code generated from C2. 6938 16.01.3.0 Thread.sleep can sleep ~30% longer than specified when the Intel pstate driver is enabled. The pstate driver can be disabled to workaround this problem with older ZVMs. You can determine whether the pstate driver has been enabled by checking /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_driver for the string “intel_pstate”. 6956 16.01.3.0 A race condition in CodeCache::GPGC_unlink can cause a crash when there are multiple GenPauselessOldThreads. This affects ZVM versions 16.01.0.0, 16.01.1.0, and 16.01.2.0. For these ZVMs, the workaround is to set -XX:GenPauselessOldThreads=1 but this can cause a spike in Old GC cycle times for applications with a large live set. 6736 16.01.2.0 Fatal error in native method: JDWP PushLocalFrame: Unable to push JNI frame, jvmtiError=AGENT_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY(188). 6124 16.01.1.0 Crash in generated code of the following method: it.unimi.dsi.fastutil.ints.IntRBTreeSet.add. 6370 16.01.1.0 GC log file SYSINFO line reports Page Cache active(file) value for the Page Cache active(anon) value. 2699 16.01.0.0 New intrinsic for BigInteger.multiplToLen() for improved BigInteger performance. 3178 16.01.0.0 The new UseCRC32Intrinsics option for improved CRC32 performance. 3910 16.01.0.0 New intrinsics for the squareToLen and mulAdd methods in BigInteger for improved BigInteger performance. 5002 16.01.0.0 The UseSuperWord ZVM option is turned on by default. It enables up to 16-byte vectorization. 5437 16.01.0.0 Memory-tracking functions to record the use of the native memory. For more details, see the Native Memory Tracking section of the Zing 16.01.0.0 User Guide. 5478 16.01.0.0 As of ZVM 14.09.0.0, a difference in the version of libstdc on the system and the libstdc version that is statically linked into libjvm could cause a crash due to malloc corruption. 5626 16.01.0.0 The printir compiler command dumps out C2 node IR phase by phase for a specific Java method. 5663 16.01.0.0 Crash with the following problematic frame: AddNode::Ideal(PhaseGVN*, bool). 5858 16.01.0.0 When the JVM core dumps, the hs error file is incorrectly reporting SCHED_IDLE threads as UNKNOWN. 5754 16.01.0.0 Crash with the following problematic frame: jvm_exception_handler. 5791 16.01.0.0 VM takes a long time to shutdown due to background page scrubbing. 6142 16.01.0.0 Crash with the following problematic frame: GraphKit::add_exception_states_from(JVMState*). 5467 15.09.1.0 Crash in Java_sun_font_ FreetypeFontScaler_disposeNativeScaler()."

  "content" : "Note This page summarizes general issues known in Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM). Large Amounts of Virtual Memory Shown by top and ps for Azul Zulu Prime Java Processes Linux tools like top, ps, etc. show large amounts of virtual memory address space for all Azul Zulu Prime Java processes in the range of several TBytes. This is an expected and normal behavior as the Azul Zulu Prime JVM utilizes a large address space for its GC algorithm. It will not take away memory resources from other processes as the memory itself is not used, just the large address space is needed. Unexpected Resident Set Size Memory Metric Shown by top and ps for Azul Zulu Prime Java Processes For the Azul Zulu Prime JVM without the Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) component (the default mode of Azul Zulu Prime JVM), the Linux top, ps, and other tools overestimate the memory use of Azul Zulu Prime Java processes. As a result, resident set sizes (RSS, RES) of more than 3 times the -Xmx value display. The reason for this is Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s usage of virtual memory multi-maps, i.e., multiple references to the same physical memory locations. To get precise metrics for the actual memory utilization, you can run the Linux smem -P java command which shows the memory usage in the PSS (proportional set size) column. However, you should only use this tool interactively for diagnostic purpose and not in a scheduled way on production systems to avoid a performance impact. There is a general latency performance impact on Linux systems when accessing the /proc/PID/smaps metric which is read by the smem tool and similar tools like atop and process-exporter, depending on their configuration. The better alternative to get an overview of the complete system memory condition is the Linux free command or /proc/meminfo as those show correct metrics without impacting performance. For Azul Zulu Prime JVM with the installed ZST component, the memory metric resident set size (RSS, RES) does not include the memory used for the Java heap and thereby shows an unexpectedly small value of only a few hundred MBytes even when you set multiple GBytes of -Xmx. The reason for this is the dedicated memory management by the ZST. For performance reasons, ZST handles the memory for Java heaps independently from Linux default memory management. Only the total amount of memory used for Java heaps is visible by standard Linux tools like, for example, shown with the free command. To list the heap memory usage for Azul Zulu Prime Java processes when ZST is installed, use the zing-ps -s command. With that, the heap memory, managed by the ZST, is shown in the Xmx column, the small amount of Linux RSS - in the LRSS column, and the memory used by Azul Zulu Prime JVM internally and managed by the ZST - in the ZRSS column. Also on Azul Zulu Prime JVM with the installed ZST, a similar effect is visible regarding the Linux metric Mlocked in /proc/meminfo. While the ZST-managed memory is protected from being swapped out, similar to a Linux mlock, it is not visible as Mlocked in /proc/meminfo. Slow Process Restart for Large Heap Sizes on Small Linux Pages In non-ZST mode on system with Linux standard configuration, i.e. disabled shared memory transparent huge pages, restarting the java process can take up to 10 seconds per 100 GB heap size. Solution: Enable shared memory transparent huge pages as described in Enable Huge Pages or install ZST. In addition, on Ubuntu, Amazon Linux or similar systems with Linux kernel 4.19.7 and newer upgrade to Azul Platform Prime 21.04.0.0 or newer. Loop predicate and loop limit check code problem The java spec says explicitly that operations on integers can overflow and no exception will be thrown. Indeed, unlike the C++ spec that says integer overflow is undefined, java says integer overflow is required to happen. Java coding guidelines always point out that using Integer.MAX_VALUE in comparison expressions is dangerous programming. Especially if it is used in a loop bound. This loop will terminate because eventually i will be equal to Integer.MAX_VALUE: for (int i=0; i<Integer.MAX_VALUE; i+=1) { … } This loop will never terminate, because i will overflow: for (int i=0; i<Integer.MAX_VALUE; i+=2) { … } Zing will sometimes terminate the loop in (2b). Note -XX:+DisableLoopOptimizations will often avoid the problem but is is only recommend as a workaround on a per-method basis. -XX:CompileCommand='disableloopopts,classname::method'"

These super-stable builds incorporate only CPUs (Critical Patch Update), PSUs (Patch Set Updates ), and Azul Platform Prime critical fixes and do not uptake new features and non-critical enhancements from Stream Builds. Stable builds can only be downloaded by Azul customers from our FTP server. Stream Builds: fast-moving monthly releases that include all the latest features and changes. Updates are not provided on Stream Builds, only on Stable Builds. Free for development and evaluation. Use in production requires an active subscription. Stream builds can be installed from Linux repositories."

  "content" : "Post Installation Tasks The following post-installation steps are not directly required when starting to use Azul Zulu Prime JVM, but it is recommended to go through them and implement any that are relevant for your environment. Install of License File Note Since Azul Zulu Prime 20.10.0.0, a license file is no longer required to run commercial packages of Azul Zulu Prime builds of OpenJDK. If you are installing Azul Zulu Prime 20.10.0.0 or later, it is not necessary to use a license file. Note that while our Stream builds are free for evaluation and development, our Stable builds do require a current subscription contract with Azul even though they do not require the use of a license file on the system. Copy the license file to your target host’s /etc/zing/ directory. To use any other file location, you must add -XX:ZingLicenseFile=<filename> to your Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance launch command. Licenses allow Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance launches up to the end of the day they are due to expire within the local timezone specified in the license file. To force Azul Prime (version 20.10 and newer) to verify the license, add the following arguments: -XX:+UseCommercialFeatures -XX:+ValidateLicenseKey. Transferring JDK Customizations If you have applied customizations to the existing non-Azul Zulu Prime JVM installation location, you might need to transfer those to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Those customizations can be, for example, JAR files added to the directory $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext or changes in the security settings below $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security. Azul Zulu Prime JVM offers the same directories to store custom JARs and security policies. Ensuring Sufficient Virtual Memory Areas Depending on the application activity and its Java object sizes, Azul Zulu Prime JVM requires a larger number of virtual memory areas (VMAs) than the Linux default of 65530. Most applications on Azul Zulu Prime JVM won’t need a change here, but to be on the safe side, set the upper limit to four times the system RAM size in MBytes. vm.max_map_count Linux system parameter defines this limit. To keep the configuration simple when managing multiple hosts, set it on all hosts to the same value as setting it too large doesn’t cause any harm. A value of 1,000,000 (one million) is recommended for systems with a RAM size of up to 256 GBytes. To set the recommended value, complete the following steps: Add the following line to the file /etc/sysctl.conf:  vm.max_map_count=1000000 To activate the setting without reboot, run:  sudo sysctl -p To check the setting on any system, type:  cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count"

  "link" : "https://docs.azul.com/prime/what-to-expect#but-its-different",
  "content" : "But It’s Different Azul Zulu Prime replaces several key components of OpenJDK with enhanced versions. This can lead to profound performance improvements in JVM behavior, such as eventual code speed and response latency. It also leads to differences in things like memory usage, warm-up, and configuration flags. Here are some of the main areas where Azul Zulu Prime differs. Garbage Collection One key benefit of Azul Platform Prime is the default garbage collector, called C4. Traditional Java garbage collectors like Parallel GC and G1 require stop-the-world pauses where the entire application pauses while garbage collection occurs. The higher your heap and the more objects that need collecting, the longer these stop-the-world pauses take. This leads to higher latencies and inconsistent transaction performance, making it especially difficult to meet SLAs. The Azul Zulu Prime C4 Garbage Collector uses a 4 stage concurrent execution mechanism that eliminates almost all stop-the-world pauses. This lets your application continue executing while garbage collection is ongoing. When testing your application under real-world conditions, you will see reduced latencies across all percentiles and especially elimination of large outliers in latency. Note The benefits of C4 will only be visible if you test real applications under real-world conditions. Running a microbenchmark for ten minutes is not likely to generate any garbage collection activity, and even running your full app in an isolated test environment with a synthetic workload often produces limited garbage collector activity. To see the true value of C4, it’s always best to perform a test in your production environment with actual real-world traffic. Memory Usage Because larger Java heaps create longer stop-the-world garbage collection pauses, many people keep the Java heap low and scale horizontally. Azul Zulu Prime minimizes stop-the-world garbage collection pauses, so you can use larger heaps without worrying about incurring high response latency during garbage collection operations. Where it makes sense, try raising your heap size within the limits of the physically available memory. Note that paging should always be avoided. Note The internals of JVM memory management for Azul Platform Prime differ from other JVMs. This results in different heap and native memory usage. Unlike OpenJDK, Azul Zulu Prime doesn’t have metaspace where it stores some objects. Azul Zulu Prime stores everything as ordinary Java objects in the Java heap. This practice simplifies heap management, since storing additional objects in the metaspace can lead to PermGen OOM errors. If you are comparing performance between OpenJDK and Azul Zulu Prime, be aware that Azul Zulu Prime is doing more in its Java heap than OpenJDK. Azul Zulu Prime has no Compressed OOPs, which means all pointers are 64bit pointers. On memory-constrained environments, this can cause differences in application performance. Generally, pauseless garbage collectors like Azul Zulu Prime’s C4 and OpenJDK’s ZGC/Shenandoah consume more heap than OpenJDK (when using traditional stop-the-world garbage collectors). Monitoring solutions that rely on JMX Beans can report memory usage for pauseless garbage collectors differently, and often incorrectly. See JMX Beans section below. Optimized Code Speed and Carrying Capacity Azul Zulu Prime replaces the Hotspot JIT compiler in OpenJDK with the Falcon JIT compiler. Falcon produces faster end-state code than Hotspot. You should see increased throughput and carrying capacity for each of your VMs, which has the side effect of being able to serve the same amount of traffic from a smaller number of VMs. Warm-up Time With all modern JMVs, when you start an application, there is a \"warm-up\" period where the application runs slower while the code is optimized and all of the post-initialization tasks of your application complete. You can see the effect of this by, for example, looking at the throughput of your tests and seeing when the throughput stabilizes. When starting the application, throughput often has a curve that looks like this while warming up. Azul Zulu Prime’s Falcon JIT compiler has different optimization levels that produce different speeds of the resulting code. The higher optimization levels that produce the fastest code come with higher upfront costs, which can take the form of longer warm-up periods with higher CPU loads. By default, Azul Platform Prime optimizes for speed, meaning we apply use a very high tier of optimizations by default. In cases where this causes too long or expensive warm-up period, you have many different options for optimizing the warm-up period. See Analyzing and Tuning Warm-up for more information. When running your performance tests, make sure that you have given the test enough time to warm up before beginning your measurements. Remember, short-running microbenchmarks may not show the real-world benefits of Azul Zulu Prime. If you are impressed by Prime’s fully optimized performance but warmup times are a concern, see ReadyNow, Azul Platform Prime’s answer for fast starts. Note JIT optimization is often only one part of what is commonly seen as \"warm-up\". Other parts of warm-up include initializing resources needed by the application, rehydrating data from caches, etc. If you are experiencing long warm-up times, make sure to analyze everything that is happening during warm-up. JMX Beans Prior to JDK 17, standard Java MX Beans did not properly track heap usage by JVMs with concurrent garbage collectors. Standard JMX Beans before JDK 17 could not tell the difference between a GC pause and a GC concurrent collection cycle, so they marked everything as pauses. Monitoring tools that rely on standard JMX Beans often report longer GC pause times for Azul Zulu Prime’s C4 garbage collector than for Stop The World garbage collectors like G1 and CMS. In general, you shouldn’t measure GC cycles with standard OpenJDK JMX metrics. Other frameworks or deployment models may make decisions based on heap usage as reported by standard JMX Beans. This can cause changes in behavior when you run these apps on Azul Platform Prime. This is because they look at overall heap usage, which see-saws. You should care more about the live set than the total heap use. Azul Platform Prime publishes its own set of JMX Beans that you can integrate with, in order to get consistent and reliable results. You can enable ZingMXBeans using the -XX:+UseZingMXBeans flag. See Monitoring the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Using JMX and Azul Platform Prime MXBeans for more details. Different Java Command-Line Options Azul Zulu Prime supports the majority of OpenJDK Java command-line options. The options that Azul Zulu Prime does not support, it ignores. Your application should always run even without having to change command-line flags. Azul Zulu Prime also has its own set of Java command-line options. Some of these, like the options for controlling compiler threads, are replacements for OpenJDK command-line options. To mimic the same behavior as in OpenJDK, you may have to update some command-line options for your application. In many cases, tuning your JVM with command-line options is much simpler with Azul Zulu Prime. For example, you can more or less delete all the command-line options around tuning Parallel GC. For most parts, C4 only needs to be given a heap size. We love to talk about Java We’re here to answer any questions about Azul performance, warmup, pricing, or anything Java.

  "content" : "JMX Beans Prior to JDK 17, standard Java MX Beans did not properly track heap usage by JVMs with concurrent garbage collectors. Standard JMX Beans before JDK 17 could not tell the difference between a GC pause and a GC concurrent collection cycle, so they marked everything as pauses. Monitoring tools that rely on standard JMX Beans often report longer GC pause times for Azul Zulu Prime’s C4 garbage collector than for Stop The World garbage collectors like G1 and CMS. In general, you shouldn’t measure GC cycles with standard OpenJDK JMX metrics. Other frameworks or deployment models may make decisions based on heap usage as reported by standard JMX Beans. This can cause changes in behavior when you run these apps on Azul Platform Prime. This is because they look at overall heap usage, which see-saws. You should care more about the live set than the total heap use. Azul Platform Prime publishes its own set of JMX Beans that you can integrate with, in order to get consistent and reliable results. You can enable ZingMXBeans using the -XX:+UseZingMXBeans flag. See Monitoring the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Using JMX and Azul Platform Prime MXBeans for more details."

  "content" : "Different Java Command-Line Options Azul Zulu Prime supports the majority of OpenJDK Java command-line options. The options that Azul Zulu Prime does not support, it ignores. Your application should always run even without having to change command-line flags. Azul Zulu Prime also has its own set of Java command-line options. Some of these, like the options for controlling compiler threads, are replacements for OpenJDK command-line options. To mimic the same behavior as in OpenJDK, you may have to update some command-line options for your application. In many cases, tuning your JVM with command-line options is much simpler with Azul Zulu Prime. For example, you can more or less delete all the command-line options around tuning Parallel GC. For most parts, C4 only needs to be given a heap size. We love to talk about Java We’re here to answer any questions about Azul performance, warmup, pricing, or anything Java.

  "content" : "Comparative Evaluation What To Do When comparing Azul Zulu Prime to different JDKs, the goal of your evaluation should be to test of your application under real-world conditions. We strongly recommend production testing to be 100% sure of the differences that can be achieved. Of course, this is not possible at all times, in which case lab testing can be used as long as the test results are providing the right insights to predict the impact when deploying Azul Zulu Prime in production. Also make sure you are running a long enough test that both systems are completely warmed up. Azul Zulu Prime can be slower or faster than OpenJDK to warm up your code to full speed, depending on the options used. Measure at what point your JVM has reached optimal speed and only start measuring your business metrics after that point, using the same (maximum) warmup period for all JDK configurations. What Not To Do When doing a comparative evaluation, you want to make sure you are measuring one change at a time. You should therefore not combine testing different JDKs with additional tuning of application, reconfiguration of the environment, or modifications to the code or the choice of third-party frameworks or libraries in the application. Just run your application exactly as you do in your default environment and run Azul with the minimal recommended tunings to get a baseline. You can then tune Azul Zulu Prime to achieve the best performance. Also, do not use a ‘open-the-flood-gates’ approach where millions of transactions/messages are simulated and crunched in one go, solely as a short-duration test aiming to reproduce a production result with a lower load over a longer time. Although this is a possible production scenario, it is very rare. In most cases, those millions of transactions/messages would be processed over some time (7, 12, 24, or more hours). The general misconception is that if the application is tested for an ‘open-the-flood-gates’ scenario, it should automatically cover all the scenarios, including the production scenario, but this is untrue. In general, all software components such as Linux, Java, Messaging platform, etc. work very differently in a typical production environment versus completely saturated conditions, and the behavior of saturated environments is not a good indicator of performance under normal loads."

  "content" : "Defining the Test Goals Each application services its unique purpose and related goals and requirements. As such, different test goals can be defined. Define the Maximum Reachable Capacity When running large Java workloads that take multiple JVMs, your primary concerns usually are : What are the success criteria for a JVM that is functioning, according to your expectations? Usually, this is a business metric such as \"99.9% of requests complete within 100ms\" or \"only 0.1% of requests result in failures\". What are the parameters that indicate a JVM is over-utilized or under-utilized, and you need to scale up or down? Often, these are technical metrics such as \"the number of requests per second\" or \"average CPU utilization\". How much load can I put through each JVM instance before I need to scale out another instance? How many instances in total do I need to serve my expected total load? Your goal in testing Azul Zulu Prime in these cases is usually to: Increase the amount of load a single JVM can handle while still meeting your success criteria. Decrease the total amount of compute-power you need to handle a given Java load. Azul has developed the TUSSLE (Throughput Under Service Level Expectation) testing framework to measure carrying capacity versus load. For more information about this tool, check the GitHub project. To see it in action, look at our benchmarking of Apache Cassandra carrying capacity. Minimize the Response Time Often your primary concern is how low and consistent you can get your response times. Financial trading systems are one typical example of this use case. Very fast responses with low latency and fewer outliers are one of the main benefits of Azul Zulu Prime. When measuring this use case, make sure you measure latency under real-world conditions and not in saturated environments. The above-mentioned TUSSLE framework can help here too. Reach the Shortest Warm-Up Time In some use cases, you require an application to be warmed up and running at optimum speed as fast possible once it starts accepting traffic. For example, you may need to reach full speed from the 10th transaction, instead of the 10,000th. In default mode, Azul Zulu Prime actually takes a longer time to warm up than OpenJDK. But when you use a tool like ReadyNow, you can in many cases reach optimum speed much quicker than with OpenJDK. How warm-up times can be measured, configured, and compared is described in detail on Analyzing and Tuning Warm-up."

  "content" : "Defining the Test Approach When evaluating your application performance on Azul Zulu Prime, or any Java runtime, it is important to adhere to the following guidelines. Important Test Strategy Considerations It is important to establish a testing approach by asking the following questions: Is there a production-like environment for testing? The closer your test workload is to production, the less likely you are going to be surprised when you promote the application to production. The best place to test the performance characteristics and value of a JVM is in the production environment. As soon as you are comfortable/able, run tests in production. When not possible to test in production, make sure you can simulate the conditions as closely as possible compared to your production environment. The goal is to be confident you will achieve the same results once you deploy Azul Zulu Prime in your production environment. Can the incoming load/request be spread like production? Production has the actual environment, workload, and monitoring you wish to evaluate against. Can the load be ingested over many hours? Long runs with real (production) workloads are more likely to capture the pain you are trying to address. Can the raw latency information be extracted from the individual transactions for the entire duration or specific duration (eg: for 3 hours after 45 min post-start-up)? Are clear and measurable success criteria defined? Focus on what matters to your business, be it response times, SLAs, timeouts,… This is where you want improvements. Enumerate the metrics (measurable properties) used to evaluate test outcomes. Can the logs (GC, profile, etc.) be extracted post-run? When evaluating ReadyNow: Can the application be restarted at certain intervals without losing the profile file from the previous run? Test Conditions To Avoid Test Type Why Avoid? Short runs Short runs are not realistic in most cases. In most cases, you want to evaluate the steady state of the application. And in most cases, you want to understand the performance profile over longer periods to capture those occasional but very bad events (such as STW GC pauses). Microbenchmarks There is a time for microbenchmarks, but not when evaluating the Java runtime for your critical application. Synthetic workloads Workloads that do not simulate production risk running tests that do not embody the problems faced in production. An application can do well on tests, only to fail once promoted to production. Insufficient cores Starving the JVM of CPU time will result in suboptimal results. Prime’s use of CPUs is not identical to OpenJDK. Ensure minimum requirements are met. Insufficient memory Prime can work with the same amount of memory as OpenJDK. However, Prime can use more memory without the usual drawbacks. Feel free to assign more memory to Prime, if available. More memory can allow for better performance. Poor metrics For instance, averages and no SLAs are considered as poor metrics. Looking at the average is rarely useful in the context of performance testing. Focus on where the pain is."

  "content" : "Installing the Development JDK The easiest way to get started is to use Azul Platform Core as your primary development JDK. Download the latest Azul Zulu build of OpenJDK for your development platform. A Zulu build of OpenJDK exists for many platforms, including both macOS and Windows. Zulu builds are drop-in replacements of Oracles Java SE and can be installed and configured in the same way. Use the download filters to choose a specific JDK and OS. The image below shows the download screen and some of the filters available. Once you’ve found an OpenJDK version, download an installation package. For MacOS, you can choose either a DMG, tar.gz, or zip package format. The easiest package for MacOS may be the DMG format. Select the DMG package. Once you’ve downloaded it, install it by double-clicking the DMG file. For the command line and other tools, you will also want to put the JDK installation binaries on your shell search path. Add the following to your shell startup file. On most macOS systems, this will be the ~/.zshrc or similar file. Your JAVA_HOME and PATH environment should look similar to this:  export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH After installation, you should be able to run the OpenJDK tools from the command line:  % java -version\nopenjdk version \"17.0.1\" 2021-10-19 LTS\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.30+15-CA (build 17.0.1+12-LTS)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.30+15-CA (build 17.0.1+12-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n% javac --version\njavac 17.0.1"

  "content" : "Installing a Docker Image for Azul Platform Prime We will use Docker Desktop for macOS. Use Docker’s Getting Started guide to download and install Docker for your host. Azul Platform Prime’s Java compiler is not different from the Azul Core compiler. Therefore, you will see no benefit from compiling with the Prime compiler. Using the Core compiler will be sufficient. However, Azul Platform Prime runtime does offers significant runtime enhancements that are not available in Core. For this reason, you may want to test your software on the Prime runtime instead of the Core runtime. This provides the added security and assurance of knowing that you have tested and even executed your application on your local system with the same runtime used in production. In a macOS or Windows development environment, you can run Prime within a Docker container to perform local unit tests and even integration tests. You can also connect to a running, local Docker container for debugging purposes. Retrieve a Prime Docker image from Docker Hub. From your shell, download an image for your preferred Linux distribution. In this instance, we will choose the azul/prime-ubuntu image.  docker pull azul/prime-ubuntu Use the following command to see your pulled images from Azul:  % docker images --filter=reference='azul/*:latest'\nREPOSITORY          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE\nazul/prime-centos   latest    c6e583988f53   45 hours ago   846MB\nazul/prime-ubuntu   latest    c8f64364f376   45 hours ago   597MB\nazul/prime          latest    c8f64364f376   45 hours ago   597MB Test your image now before going further.

  "content" : "Running the Application Once you’ve integrated the Docker tools, you are ready to set up your application. We have chosen the Spring Boot Pet Clinic application to demonstrate full integration with our development toolchain. Use the following on your command line to download the Pet Clinic source code:  git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/spring-petclinic-docker.git This version of Pet Clinic has a runnable Dockerfile in the root directory. From within IntelliJ IDEA, simply select Open on the downloaded project directory. IntelliJ IDEA will recognize the maven project. Select Run > Edit Configurations. Select the + symbol to add a new Dockerfile run configuration. Choose the Dockerfile option for a new run configuration. Name the configuration \"Pet Clinic\". Select the Dockerfile file in the root of the application to build. Use pet-clinic as the \"Container name\", so we can easily identify this application in the list of running Docker applications. Because the running Docker container will use port 8080, you must also export this port. Select Modify→ Bind Ports to map port 8080 on the host to port 8080 within the container. Build the project before starting the Docker, by adding a \"Run Maven Goal\" in the \"Before lauch setting\", with the command line package. Finally, select Apply and then OK to create the run configuration. Our Dockerfile is quite simple. We simply use the azul/prime-ubuntu image, copy the jar, and run the application into the updated image:  FROM azul/prime-ubuntu\n\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY target/spring-petclinic-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar petclinic.jar\nCMD [\"java\", \"-jar\", \"petclinic.jar\"] Note depending on the sources of the Petclinic example you downloaded, you may need to modify the filename of target/spring-petclinic-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar. You can test that the run configuration works by selecting Run > Run 'Pet Clinic` from the IntelliJ IDEA menu. After giving the container and application a few seconds to initialize, you can access the demonstration application from a browser at localhost:8080. With the docker ps command you can check the status of the Docker application.  docker ps\n\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES\nee15e325a503   cda90d73e71e   \"java -jar petclinic…\"   5 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds   0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   pet-clinic You can validate the used Java version in the Docker image by executing a command inside the Docker with the interactive -it option:  docker exec -it pet-clinic java -version\n\njava version \"17.0.5\" 2022-10-27 LTS\nJava Runtime Environment Zing22.10.0.0+3 (build 17.0.5+8-LTS)\nZing 64-Bit Tiered VM Zing22.10.0.0+3 (build 17.0.5-zing_22.10.0.0-b3-product-linux-aarch64, mixed mode) Debugging the Application within the Docker Container In addition to running your application in a Docker image, you will be able to debug the container as well. To do this, you will need to add a remote debugging configuration to the IDE. Select Run > Edit Configurations. Click the + symbol. Select Remote JVM Debug to add a debug configuration. Give the configuration a name, Debug Spring Pet Clinic. Also, we need to add a Before launch step. Add a new task to launch Docker before debugging. Add the following custom command to the Before launch step. This command starts the Docker container with options to enable remote debugging on port 5005 and exposes that port on the host.  java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005 -jar petclinic.jar The Before launch step is shown below in IntelliJ IDEA: Click OK to close the Docker configuration dialog box. Finally, select Apply and OK to close the new debug configuration. To begin a debug session, select Run→Debug 'Debug Spring Pet Clinic' from the IntelliJ IDEA menu. This begins a remote JVM debug session after launching the container image we’ve defined earlier. You can now set breakpoints in your application code as needed. Your application is running with Azul Platform Prime’s optimized Java runtime within a debuggable Docker image. Summary Azul Platform Prime is available in a Dockerized container image that can be integrated into your local development environment. Even if you use macOS or Windows as your host development platform, the Docker image allows you to run your application using the same Azul Platform Prime runtime.

  "content" : "Falcon Optimization Notes The main focus of the Falcon compiler is generating high performance code. This may result in longer compile times because additional CPU time is required for higher levels of optimization. Longer Falcon compile times can increase the application startup and warm-up times when compared to the startup and warm-up times when running Azul Zulu Prime JVM using the C2 compiler. Falcon fully supports Azul ReadyNow technology, which helps improve consistency of application performance during warmup. While future versions of Azul Zulu Prime JVM will likely include automatic ongoing eviction of contents in the Falcon cache, the current Azul Zulu Prime JVM version does not, and as of version 18.01.0.0, the Falcon cache is not automatically cleared or evicted. The cache will accumulate contents up to FalconMaxCacheSize. Once it reaches that size, newly encountered compilations will no longer be added to the cache. The cache can be reset at any time (including while the Azul Zulu Prime JVM is running) by destroying the contents of the cache with, for example, rm -r .zing-falcon-cache."

If, for some reason, you need to switch to the non-default Tier 2 C2 compiler in Azul Platform Prime 17.03.0.0 - 20.03.1.0, use the -XX:+UseC2 option. For example,  $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -XX:+UseC2 –cp . myprog Starting with Azul Platform Prime 20.04.0.0, the -XX:+UseC2 option can use one of two separate implementations of C2 JIT compilation: A traditional SeaOfNodesC2 mode. A C2 implementation that has been part of Azul Platform Prime since 2010. A new KestrelC2 mode. A newer C2 implementation introduced to Azul Platform Prime in 2020. It is based on a lightweight use of the LLVM backend, and typically produces faster code than SeaOfNodesC2 while keeping compilation effort at similar levels. Both KestrelC2 and SeaOfNodesC2 typically exhibit significantly lower compilation-time CPU consumption than Falcon. Note that while C2 is entirely supported, active development has mostly stopped. As such, switching to C2 should be seen as a workaround until a Falcon issue can be resolved, and you are encouraged to retry Falcon after every major upgrade."

The Examples below both specify a 10 GB heap: -Xmx10240M -Xmx10G Minimum heap size is as follows: Minimum heap size: 512 MB Maximum heap size without ZST: 2500 GB (2.5 TB) Maximum heap size with ZST: 20000 GB (20 TB) The default heap size is 1 GB, except in the following situations: Container environments or under cgroups: here it matches OpenJDK and is 25% of the cgroup or container limit. The upper limit of the default value is 32 GB. With enabled heap elasticity, available since version 21.05.0.0, see Recommended Heap Size for details. Same as OpenJDK: 25% of the RAM size or cgroup/container limit, with a maximum value of 32 GB. -Xms<size>[m|M|g|G] Specifies the minimum size of the Java heap that is committed at the start of the Java command. During uptime, the Garbage Collector uses this minimum value as target heap utilization to minimize the memory footprint. For application environments with the primary goal of reducing latency and obtaining the highest throughput performance, setting -Xms to the value of -Xmx is recommended to avoid CPU intensive memory optimization. The default value depends on the system RAM and ranges from 512 MB to 2 GB. When ZST is installed, this flag is ignored and the initial heap size is always set to the -Xmx value, except when heap elasticity is enabled. Heap elasticity is only available since 21.05.0.0. See Recommended Heap Size for details. 1.5625% of the RAM size or cgroup/container limit, with a minimum value of 512 MB and a maximum value of 2 GB. -XX:MaxHeapSize=<size>[k|K|m|M|g|G] Can be used instead of -Xmx<size>, see above. -XX:InitialHeapSize=<size>[k|K|m|M|g|G] Can be used instead of -Xms<size>, see above. -XX:JavaMemMax=<size>[k|K|m|M|g|G] Specifies the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM process (the Java heap). Units can be specified in kilobytes (K or k), megabytes (M or m), or gigabytes (G or g). For example: -XX:JavaMemMax=2g -XX:JavaMemMax=128M -XX:JavaMemMax=128m If this option is not specified the maximum size to which Java heap can grow is calculated internally by the JVM based on the size of the Java system memory. Contact Azul customer support for more information about this option. You might need this option when multiple JVMs are run on the same host and frequent usage of contingency or pause prevention memory has been observed. Value of -Xmx plus available Contingency Memory -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=<value> This is an alternative to -Xms and defines the initial heap size as percentage of the RAM of the machine, container or cgroup. With JDK 8, a decimal number is required as value, like 5.0. On JDK 11 and later integer numbers are also accepted. This parameter is only used when Heap Elasticity is enabled. 1.5 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=<value> This is an alternative to -Xmx and defines the maximum heap size as percentage of the RAM of the machine, container or cgroup. With JDK 8, a decimal number is required as value, like 75.0. On JDK 11 and later integer numbers are also accepted. The default value is 25.0, but the default is capped to a maximum of 32 GB. 25 -XX:[+/-]AutoTuneResourceDefaultsBasedOnXmx Allows Azul Zulu Prime JVM to start with Xmx128M or Xmx256M by reducing default values for some parameters such as ReservedCodeCacheSize and GC thread count. The flag is automatically set to true for java -version, -help, etc. true -XX:[+/-]UseZST Allows Azul Zulu Prime JVM to start with or without the Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) component. false -XX:NonZSTModePreferenceLevel=<value> Sets the preference selection for launching Azul Zulu Prime JVM with ZST. The selection choices are as follows: 0 - Never select the non-ZST mode. Azul Zulu Prime JVM will error out if ZST is not installed, configured, or enabled. 1 - Select the non-ZST mode only if ZST is not installed properly.

Explicitly setting this options disables dynamic allocation. 100 for ZST reserve-at-config, 95 for ZST reserve-at-launch, 90 for non-ZST mode -XX:GenPauselessNewThreads=<value> Specifies the number of garbage collection worker threads for the new generation. Setting default value is based off of Xmx: If Xmx is more than 2 GB, the default value is 45% of the number of logical cores available to the process. If Xmx is less than or equal to 2 GB, the default value is either Xmx divided by 128 MB or 45% of the number of logical cores available to the process, whichever is smaller. If -XX:+UseSTW is specified, the default value is the number of logical cores. available to the process. The minimum value supported is 1. If not set, this value can be managed dynamically using . See note in -XX:GPGCThreads. 15 -XX:GenPauselessOldThreads=<value> Specifies the number of garbage collection worker threads for the old generation. Setting default value is based off of Xmx: If Xmx is more than 2 GB, the default value is 30% of the number of logical cores available to the process. If Xmx is less than or equal to 2 GB, the default value is either 66% (two thirds) of the value of GenPauselessNewThreads, or 30% of the number of logical cores available to the process, whichever is smaller. When -XX:+UseSTW is specified, the default value is the same as the number of logical cores available to the process. The minimum value supported is 1. If not set, this value can be managed dynamically using . See note in -XX:GPGCThreads. 9 -XX:GPGCThreads=<value> Specifies the total number of garbage collection worker threads This is an alternative way to specify GenPauselessNewThreads and GenPauselessOldThreads When used, GenPauselessOldThreads is derived as 40% of GPGCThreads. GenPauselessNewThreads is then derived as GPGCThreads – GenPauselessOldThreads. The default value is the sum of the default values of GenPauselessNewThreads and GenPauselessOldThreads. The minimum value supported is 2. Note As of Azul Platform Prime 21.10.0.0, if the values GPGCThreads, GenPauslessNewThreads, and GenPauselessOldThreads are not set, the number of garbage collector worker threads are managed dynamically using UseDynamicNumberOfGCThreads, if enabled, according to the configuration of GPGCDynamicGCThreadCountPolicy. 24 -XX:[+/-]UseDynamicNumberOfGCThreads Turn on/off dynamic changes to GC thread counts. true -XX:GPGCDynamicGCThreadCountPolicy=<value> Enable dynamic garbage collection thread count policy. 0 - Disable dynamic handling. Set a static garbage collector thread count that is fixed to the -XX:GPGCThreads value. 1 - The garbage collector thread count is managed automatically and will dynamically increase but never decrease. The thread count is limited by -XX:GPGCThreads=N. 2 - The garbage collector thread count is managed automatically and will be increased and decreased dynamically. The thread count is limited by -XX:GPGCThreads=N. 1 -XX:[+/-]ConcurrentJVMTITagMapClearing Lower GC pauses with JVMTI, resolving deadlock with callbacks during JVMTI tag map clearing true -XX:[+/-]GPGCUseTargetCPUHeuristic If disabled, will cause CPU-based heuristics to be skipped for heap elasticity and dynamic GC thread counts. true -XX:[+/-]GPGCSafepointWaitForMutatorResume Tells the Garbage Collector to pause and wait for mutator threads to be woken up before resuming, after every GC safepoint. If -XX:-GPGCSafepointWaitForMutatorResume is set, the Garbage Collector resumes its work in parallel with mutator threads waking up. true Per-thread CPU utilization in GC Log Available from Azul Platform Prime 23.06.0.0, the per-thread CPU utilization options allow collection and charting of per-thread CPU core statistics. Command-Line Option Description Default -XX:[+/-]PrintCPUUtilization Enable printing of CPU utilization for process threads in JDK8-style logging. false -Xlog:gc,cpuut:<filename> Enable printing of CPU utilization for process threads in unified logging. - -XX:PrintCPUUtilizationAtIntervalSec=<time in seconds> Interval in seconds, at which CPU utilization statistics will be printed to GC log.

  "content" : "Advanced Miscellaneous Options Command-Line Option Description Default -XX:[+/-]OptimizeFindDeadlocksWithCheckpoint Enable elimination of safepoint pauses for finding deadlocks operations by first attempting to complete them using a checkpoint. If a deadlock is detected in the checkpoint, it is then confirmed using a safepoint pause. true -XX:DiagnosticFolder=<path> Gathers all useful diagnostic logs into one folder for easier evaluation. none -XX:[+/-]PrintGCHSLines Enables writing system information headers (GCHS) in the garbage collection log file. true if GC logging is enabled, false if GC logging is disabled -XX:[+/-]PrintGCExtraDetails Enables a new Garbage Collector logging level used wherever the data collection or reporting has a noticeable overhead. This flag also enables PrintGCDetails which is the next lower logging level. false -XX:[+/-]PromoteCheckpoints Lets tardy threads complete the checkpoint process by pausing active threads. See Troubleshooting Guide for suggestions on when to use this option. false -XX:CheckpointPromotionDelay=<time in ms> Defines the threshold for triggering the promotion timeout. This flag has an effect when -XX:+PromoteCheckpoints is specified. 850 -XX:ProfileStartupLimitInSeconds=<value in seconds> Sets time limit for ReadyNow to wait for compilations to finish at startup as specified in seconds. -1 (infinite) -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=<number of CPUs> Allows for specifying explicitly the number of CPUs available for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Works only with the container support (i.e., if -XX:-UseContainerSupport is not specified) and overrides the automatic CPU detection logic in the JVM. -1 -XX:[+/-]UseContainerSupport Turns off using container-specific information about available CPUs instead of using the information about the whole system. Enabled by default. true -XX:[+/-]DashVersionSilenceLicenseErrors Starting with Azul Zulu Prime JVM 18.07.0.0, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM diagnoses licensing problems if run with -version option: it prints a warning and exits with an error code. If this option is specified together with -version, the JVM ignores licensing problems (specifically the warning is not printed) and exits with 0. Setting the ZING_DASH_VERSION_SILENCE_LICENSE_ERRORS environment variable has the same effect. false -XX:[+/-]PreserveFramePointer (Available since Azul Zulu Prime JVM 17.03.0.0; requires ZST 5.18.0 or later) The flag is needed for producing flame graphs with the Linux perf utility and for similar performance analysis tools which rely on stackwalking to record Java method invocations, the time percentage spent in them, and their use of Linux system function calls. false -XX:[+/-]UseLLVMBasedDisassembler Turns the LLVM-based disassembler off. Starting with Azul Zulu Prime JVM 18.07.0.0, the default disassembler is changed from Azul Zulu Prime JVM internal to LLVM-based. true -XX:PrintAssemblyOptions=intel <diagnostic> Changes disassembly syntax from AT&T to intel. This flag is diagnostic and must be preceded by -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions. -XX:[+/-]UseModifiedThreadLocal Internally polls on a ReferenceQueue to determine if a key object has been garbage collected rather than polling by checking for NULL through the Reference.get() API, that can unintentionally prevent the weakly reachable key from being garbage collected. The flag is more friendly to garbage collectors that perform marking concurrently. true -XX:[+/-]UseSpecialArrayCopy Indicates which version of arraycopy of objects intrinsic works with. When set to true, it stands for a new vectorized intrinsic version. When set to false, it stands for the old scalar version. true -Xnativevmflags:[ignore|error|warn] If -Xnativevmflags:error is specified and the Azul Zulu Prime JVM detects an option that it does not support, it does not launch and generates the following type of message: HotSpot™ 64-Bit Tiered VM error: Unsupported native VM option ‘+UseParNewGC’ If -Xnativevmflags:warn is specified as a last option in the command line, it enables a warning message for each OpenJDK JVM option ignored by Azul Zulu Prime JVM. It prints a warning message while your application starts normally, for example: $ /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/bin/java -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xnativevmflags:warn -version Zing 64-Bit Tiered VM warning: Ignoring unsupported native VM option '+UseParallelGC' java version \"1.8.0-zing_18.12.0.0\" Zing Runtime Environment for Java Applications (build 1.8.0-zing_18.12.0.0-b4) Zing 64-Bit Tiered VM (build 1.8.0-zing_18.12.0.0-b9-product-azlinuxM-X86_64, mixed mode) ignore -XX:[+/-]ResetSignalMaskAtLaunch Clears the signal mask to enable SIGQUITs when set to true. true -XX:ProfilePreMainTier2ExtraCompilerThreads=<number of threads> Enables the use of extra threads for compilations for C2 and Falcon during the pre-main phase when ReadyNow triggers and executes different activities. This option is complementary to CIMaxCompilerThreads. In pre-main phase when your code is not yet being executed and GC is silent, the total amount of C2/Falcon compiler threads is equal to the sum of CIMaxCompilerThreads and ProfilePreMainTier2ExtraCompilerThreads. Note that the sum is capped to match the number of CPUs available for Azul Zulu Prime JVM on a machine. When the pre-main phase is done (i.e., ProfileStartupLimitInSeconds is exhausted) and your main is started, the total amount of compiler thread goes back to standard CIMaxCompilerThreads. 2 -XX:ProfileWorkerThreads=<number of threads> When this option value is greater than 0, it allows ReadyNow to use multiple concurrent background threads to asynchronously trigger and execute different ReadyNow-related activities such as early class loading, class initializations, or trigger compilations.When the flag value is set to 0, old synchronous event’s triggering and/or processing is used. The default value is equal to the minimum number of CPUs available for Azul Zulu Prime JVM on a machine. 4 -XX:[+/-]RunVMErrorOnUnhandledSignals Does error reporting for SIGABRT, SIGFPE, and SIGTRAP signals if there are no user defined handlers installed. true -XX:[+/-]SafelyTrustEffectivelyFinalFields Enables effectively final optimizations for private fields which are initialized inside a constructor or class initializer, but are otherwise read only. The effectively final family of optimizations allows the VM to perform compiler optimization as if the fields were constants, but deoptimize if a later write is detected at runtime. true -XX:[+/-]UseOpenJSSE Enables the OpenJSSE provider that supports TLS 1.3, see https://github.com/openjsse/openjsse for details. false -XX:[+/-]UseLegacy8uJSSE Enables the Legacy8uJSSE provider that includes the 8u252 JSSE provider implementation without TLS 1.3 support as a fallback measure, and the non-default OpenJSSE provider previously included in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 8 distributions for non-default support for TLS 1.3. See Using Version 1.3 of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol for details. false -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=<percentage of the memory limit> Adjusts the maximum heap size (if not explicitly specified) based on the configured cgroup memory limit. If Xmx is not specified, the VM heap size limit is calculated as (MaxRAMPercentage / 100) * cgroups_limit. 25 -XX:[+/-]AlignArrayStart Enables 64-bit alignment of the starting point of any array in the heap memory. true -XX:HserrRawCodeWindowSize=<size in bytes> Specifies the size of raw x86 instructions to dump into hs_err file. 512 -XX:MlockLevel=<level> Selects the memory locking strategy during JVM initialization: 0 - Do not attempt any mlock in the JVM. 1 - Lock only libjvm.so text region (can mlock up to 20 MB). 2 - Lock all existing memory regions before JVM initialization (can mlock up to 150MB). 3 - Lock all existing memory regions at the end of JVM initialization (can mlock up to 500 MB with ZST mode, additionally locks the complete Xmx with non-ZST mode). Note that for the mlock operation to succeed the user should have permission to lock the required amount of memory in RAM. Check the ulimit l setting before starting the JVM with the MlockLevel option. Only a privileged user can increase this limit. By default, no error message is printed if the mlock operation fails. Adding 1000 to the values above results in the same operation performed with errors, if any, printed to stderr. For example, specifying -XX:MlockLevel=1001 will print a warning if locking libjvm.so text region fails but -XX:MlockLevel=1 will not. 1 -XX:[+/-]KeepCodeEntrantOnAsyncExceptions Keeps code of the compiled method entrant for further utilization (instead of making it non-entrant) in the case when an asynchronous exception (OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError) occurs during the execution of the JIT-compiled version of the method. false -XX:[+/-]ProfileExitOnInputError Exits when an input profile is specified but cannot be found or is malformed. The option is applicable when file_name is missing for -XX:ProfileLogIn=<filename>. false -XX:[+/-]UseFastJNIAccessors Enables JNI Get<type>Field function optimization. When the optimization is enabled, the function tries to quickly access the field value first. If it is not possible (e.g., garbage collection is in progress), the value is retrieved with the standard procedure. true -XX:[+/-]UseSpecialHashSet Enables optimization for a special HashSet filling pattern when elements of the input collection are frequently added into an empty HashSet. false -XX:[+/-]UseThreadStateNativeWrapperProtocol Enables lock-less JNI transitions. This flag needs a minimum of 4K available lockable memory to be enabled. Otherwise, the flag ergonomically resets to false. true -XX:[+/-]UseKestrelC2 Enables a newer C2 implementation introduced to Azul Zulu Prime JVM in 2020. It is based on a lightweight use of the LLVM backend, and typically produces faster code than UseSeaOfNodesC2 while keeping compilation effort at similar levels. UseKestrelC2 generally exhibits a significantly lower compilation-time CPU consumption compared to Falcon. This option is complementary to UseC2. true -XX:[+/-]UseSeaOfNodesC2 Note Deprecated since 24.01.0.0 Enables the traditional C2 implementation that has been part of Azul Zulu Prime JVM since 2010. This option is complementary to UseC2. false -XX:ZingTestingGracePeriodSec=<value in seconds> Specifies the Azul Zulu Prime JVM testing grace period, in seconds (up to 3600). 0 -XX:[+/-]UseFastJNIExceptionCheck Enables the JNI ExceptionCheck function optimization. When the optimization is enabled, the function tries to quickly check for a synchronous pending exception. If an async exception is set, the exception check happens with the standard procedure. true -XX:[+/-]MaxFDLimit Enables the attempt to set the soft limit for the number of open file descriptors to the hard limit. true -XX:[+/-]UseLegacyJNINameEscaping Enables skipping the extra mapping check to avoid compatibility issues due to new mapping rules for JNI methods introduced in JDK-8233624. See New mapping rules from a Java native method name to a C native library implementation function name for more information about new mapping rules. false -XX:[+/-]GPGCReportJavaHeapPoolMXBean Exposes the total sum of memory usage of all MemoryPoolMXBean memory pools to the java.lang.management interface. false -XX:GPGCHeapJavaPoolMXBeanName=<value> Specifies the name of the total java heap pool only when GPGCShowJavaHeapPoolMXBean is enabled. 0 -XX:GPGCNewGenPoolMXBeanName=<value> Specifies the name of the new generation in the java heap pool. 0 -XX:GPGCOldGenPoolMXBeanName=<value> Specifies the name of the old generation in the java heap pool. 0 -XX:GPGCPermGenPoolMXBeanName=<value> Specifies the name of the permanent generation in the java heap pool. 0 -XX:[+/-]UseModifiedRuleBasedCollator Enable the use of the custom implementation of RuleBasedCollator to improve performance over OpenJDK’s text collation and normalization. true -XX:[+/-]UseModifiedInputStreams Use unsynchronized ByteArrayInputStream if it is used as an input of ObjectInputStream as a custom implementation. false -XX:[+/-]UseContainerCpuShares Consider CPU shares when computing available processors inside a cgroup. false -XX:[+/-]PreferContainerQuotaForVMInternalCPUCount Use CPU quota divided by period as base for calculating VM internal thread counts in containers. true from Azul Platform Prime 23.08.0.0. -XX:[+/-]PreferContainerSharesForVMInternalCPUCount Use CPU shares divided by 1024 as base for calculating VM internal thread counts in containers. false"

As of Azul Zulu Prime JVM release 5.10.0, the default value the Azul Zulu Prime JVM flag DisableExplicitGC is off. Prior to release 5.10.0, calls to System.gc() were ignored and no garbage collection was initiated unless -XX:-DisableExplicitGC was set. From 5.10.0 this is no longer the case and System.gc() calls may initiate a full GC cycle depending on the value of the GPGCOptimisticExplicitGC flag. If a System.gc() call initiates a garbage collection, the calling thread may or may not be blocked for the duration of the GC depending on the value of the SynchronousExplicitGC flag. The previous behavior is achieved by turning on the DisableExplicitGC flag, using -XX:+DisableExplicitGC. -XX:[+/-]GPGCOptimisticExplicitGC When enabled, a thread calling System.gc() initiates a new garbage collection if and only if one is not already in progress or one is pending. This flag is enabled by default. -XX::[+/-]SynchronousExplicitGC When enabled, a thread that initiates a garbage collection by calling System.gc() is blocked for the entire garbage collection cycle and resumes when the GC completes. Otherwise, a concurrent garbage collection is initiated and the calling thread continues to execute. This flag is enabled by default."

  "content" : "Speculative Locking Options Speculative Locking in the Azul Zulu Prime JVM leverages the Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel® TSX) instruction set, to take advantage of the situation where there is lock contention between threads, but no data contention inside the locked region. If a multithreaded program can concurrently modify shared data, a synchronized block or method is usually necessary to ensure correctness. This causes lock contention. The synchronization is not necessary if the concurrent accesses are to different parts of the shared data. In other words, a lock is not necessary when there is no data contention inside the locked region. For example, two different threads can modify a hash table concurrently without taking a lock, if they change values in different buckets of the hash table. Speculative Locking elides locks by speculating that there is no data contention. It does so by starting a transaction using Intel TSX instructions. If the speculation turns out to be wrong, the Intel TSX enabled CPU will detect it, abort the transaction and roll back execution to the start of lock. If a transaction gets aborted, the VM, using certain heuristics, either retries speculation or just acquires the lock as usual. The heuristic maintains aborted or attempted transactions for every speculated lock and disables speculation on that lock if it detects a high aborted or attempted value. The following table summarizes the command-line options that control the use of speculative locking in Azul Zulu Prime JVM. The command lines options are case-sensitive. Command-Line Option Description Default -XX:[+/-]UseRTMLocking Enables speculative locking. false -XX:[+/-]RTMHeuristic Enables (Restricted Transactional Memory) RTM heuristics. true -XX:RTMAbortRatio=<threshold value> Threshold value for RTM heuristics. If aborted or attempted transactions ratio goes beyond this limit for a monitor then speculation is disabled for that monitor. 50 -XX:RTMRetryCount=<attempts> Number of times speculation is attempted on a monitor, per lock acquisition. Fewer, or no attempts will be made if internal heuristic disables speculation on the monitor. 5 Note that RTMHeuristic, RTMAbortRatio, and RTMRetryCount options are meaningful if the UseRTMLocking option is true."

  "content" : "Falcon Compiler Options The Falcon compiler is an optimizing JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler that is the default Azul Zulu Prime JVM compiler starting from the Azul Zulu Prime JVM release 17.03.0.0. Below are the Falcon-specific command-line options: Option Description -XX:[+/-]UseFalcon Specifies which Tier 2 compiler should be used. The default Tier 2 compiler is Falcon. To use the C2 JIT instead of the Falcon JIT, run the following command: $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -XX:-UseFalcon –cp . myprog -Xcompilerflags:ignore|warn|error Controls the handling of a C2 or Falcon specific flag used when the other compiler is active. The default value is \"warn\". -XX:[+/-]UseFalconOSR Controls the On Stack Replacement (OSR) functionality. OSR is enabled by default. It is not recommended to disable this option. If needed, disable it for only diagnostics purposes. -XX:Tier2OSRThreshold=<threshold value> Changes the threshold at which the OSR is triggered – that is loop compilation by C2 or Falcon compiler. The default value is 14000. The value might be decreased to improve warm-up characteristics. -XX:FalconCompileThreshold=<threshold value> Threshold value for the Falcon JIT compiler. Replaces the identical option of the C2 compiler (-XX:C2CompileThreshold). The default value is 10000. -XX:CompileCommand Sets the compile threshold for a particular method, used in the following way: -XX:CompileCommand=\"option,<Class>::<method>,FalconCompileThreshold=<threshold value>\" -XX:+UseKestrelC2 Disables Falcon and switches to the KestrelC2 compiler. -XX:FalconUseAVX Specifies the highest supported AVX instructions set on x86/x64 CPUs. The default value is 2. -XX:[+/-]FalconUseLegacyInliner This option is deprecated with no replacement starting with the release of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.02.0.0. Switches back to the old implementation of the LLVM inliner instead of using a highly customized integrated inliner to perform inlining optimizations in Falcon compiles. The default value is false. -XX:FalconOptimizationLevel=<3,2,1,0> Controls the level of compiling optimization. The default value is 2 (full Falcon). Suggested use: the default value is expected to fit most cases. However, if the CPU load at warmup is too high or warmup takes too long, there is a reason to try 1. The downside is that peak performance might be lower with that setting. Accepts values from 0 to 3: 0 - minimal optimizations, lowest CPU consumption by Falcon (not recommended for production) 1 - reasonable optimizations and CPU time/warmup (good for production) 2 - aggressive optimizations, might expose high CPU utilization in some cases (default) 3 - turns on very aggressive optimizations known to cause long compilations and high CPU load at warmup (not recommended for production) -XX:[+/-]FalconPreserveBoxingIdentity Disables aggressive optimization of boxing types (integer, double, etc.). Should only be used for applications which are found to rely on implementation defined behavior as opposed to the specified behavior of boxing routines. The default value is false. -XX:FalconGenerateProfilerInfo=<value> Specifies the method inlining detail level for performance profiling output of compiled code. Setting a lower level may help to reduce compiled code size by a few percent. Accepts values from 0 to 2: 0 - no method inlining information is generated 1 - stack of inlined methods is generated only (default) 2 - stack of inlined methods with bytecode indices (bci) is generated -XX:[+/-]FalconCompensateForIntelMCUForErratumSKX102 Introduces a nop padding based mitigation for performance regressions seen on some systems following Intel’s micro code updates in response to errata SKX102. This option is expected to become the default in a future Azul Zulu Prime JVM release. If enabled, nop padding is used to align affected branches on systems with the micro code update applied. The default value is false. -XX:[+/-]ForceFalconCompensateForIntelMCUForErratumSKX102 Forces generation of nop padded code on unaffected systems for performance validation. The default value is false. -XX:[+/-]FalconOptBoxing Enables the optimization to eliminate redundant boxing conversions. The default value is true. -XX:[+/-]FalconLockCoarsenOverLoop Enables a lock coarsening optimization for loops where the lock over a loop is coarsened. This is done by chunking the loop and coarsening the lock over the chunked loop. The default value is true. -XX:[+/-]FalconEnableAggressiveLockOpt Enables loop chunking by chunk size of 32 and performs lock coarsening over the loop. Additionally, enables lock coarsening over memory operations with monitor exit when valid to do so. The default value is true. NOTE: The Falcon compiler is available for Java 7, Java 8, Java 11, Java 13, and Java 15. An attempt to use the -XX:+UseFalcon option for Java 6 will cause a failure."

Note Starting with ZVM 19.12.0.0, Compile Stashing is not enabled by default with the -XX:ProfileLogOut command-line option. Compile Stashing is still enabled by default only in combination with the -XX:ProfileLogIn command-line option. Use -XX:+FalconUseCompileStashing if you need to turn on Compile Stashing, and -XX:-FalconUseCompileStashing to turn it off. The structure of a disk cache location can change. It is safe to delete an arbitrary file from a directory. The default configuration when all Azul Zulu Prime JVMs use the same cache is beneficial because the JVMs can reuse each other’s compilations when all JVM instances running on the same machine use the same cache. To avoid the slowdown of the Compile Stashing read, write, and lookup functions, make sure the cache file system is fast (for example, stored locally)."

  "content" : "The -Xmx or -XX:MaxRAMPercentage command line parameters specifies the maximum Java heap size. That’s the amount of memory available for the Java application running on Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) to store its objects and classes. Starting with Azul Platform Prime 21.07.0.0, the heap elasticity feature is enabled by default when Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) are not installed. Heap elasticity provides elastic expansion and shrinking of the Java heap. The garbage collector tries to minimize the memory footprint, keeping it between the user-defined range of -Xms and -Xmx. At the same time, Azul Platform Prime monitors the CPU usage of the garbage collector and relaxes the memory minimizing goal when the CPU usage increases too much. The metrics used to determine when to acquire or release memory are the percentage of wall-clock time the garbage collector concurrently (GC Time % metric visible in the GC Log Analyzer) and the CPU utilization of the GC threads. By default, the GC tries to keep the GC time below 40%, and the CPU utilization below 5% of all available CPUs. Memory is released when the GC time drops below 3%. Flags to define the Java heap size: -Xmx<size>[m|M|g|G] Specifies the maximum size of the Java heap. Examples to specify a 10GB heap: -Xmx10240M or -Xmx10G The minimum value is 512 MB. Starting with Azul Zulu Prime 21.05.0.0, the default value when no -Xmx parameter is set matches OpenJDK and is 25% of the system RAM or cgroup/container limit. The upper limit of the default value is 32GB. The possible maximum setting is 2500GB (2.5TB). When ZST is installed, the default value is 1GB and the maximum is 20000GB (20TB). -Xms<size>[m|M|g|G] Starting with 21.07.0.0, this flag specifies the minimum size of the Java heap that is committed at the start of the Java process. During uptime, the garbage collector uses this minimum value as target heap utilization to minimize the memory footprint. For application environments with primary goal of reducing latency and highest throughput performance, you should set -Xms to the value of -Xmx to avoid CPU-intensive memory optimization. The default value is 1.5625% of the total system memory or cgroup/container limit, and ranges from 512 MB to 2 GB. When ZST is installed, this parameter is ignored and the minimum heap size equal to -Xmx, except when heap elasticity is enabled. -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=<value> This is an alternative to -Xmx and defines the maximum heap size as percentage of the RAM of the machine, container or cgroup. With JDK 8, a decimal number is required as value, like 75.0. On JDK 11 and later integer numbers are also accepted. -XX:InitialRAMPercentage=<value> This is an alternative to -Xms and defines the initial heap size as percentage of the RAM of the machine, container or cgroup. With JDK 8, a decimal number is required as value, like 5.0. On JDK 11 and later integer numbers are also accepted. For application environments with primary goal of reducing latency and highest throughput performance, you should set InitialRAMPercentage to the value of MaxRAMPercentage to avoid CPU-intensive memory optimization."

  "content" : "Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) is a component of Azul Platform Prime that allows you to coordinate memory usage between Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) and the underlying Linux operating system. Azul Platform Prime’s C4 garbage collector works the same way, with or without ZST. ZST enables Azul Platform Prime to support larger heap sizes, and to provide better memory management on older operating system versions that don’t have the required functionality already built in. Generally, it is simpler to run Azul Platform Prime without ZST. Your operational overhead may be less complex without the need to manage ZST installation and configuration. However, there are some conditions which require the use of ZST, and there are some operational considerations which could also mean that ZST is a preference for you. As of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07, ZST becomes an optional component for Azul Platform Prime. With modern Linux kernels, the Linux kernel itself can provide most of the functionality that ZST provides. For most applications, the functionality now provided by modern Linux kernels is sufficient for good application performance on Azul Platform Prime, so we no longer require the use of ZST. However, there are some things that ZST can do that even the most modern Linux kernels can not, so in some cases, using ZST is still required, or desired if it gives better performance or simpler system management, and thus ZST remains an optional component for use with Azul Platform Prime."

Each of these has different minimum operating system requirements, so a table format may be helpful. Read on below the table for details about each of the considerations. Minimum Operating System versions to run Azul Platform Prime in each of these configuration types: Azul Platform Prime without ZST - Recommended if ZST is not otherwise required or beneficial. Azul Platform Prime without ZST, with Transparent Huge Pages - Recommended for heap sizes 100 GB or more or if lower throughput or reduced start time is seen without ZST. Azul Platform Prime with ZST - Required for heap sizes over 2.5 TB and for older operating systems. Useful in environments where you can’t otherwise guarantee available memory at application launch time Operating System Without ZST Without ZST, With Transparent Huge Pages With ZST Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 or later 8 or later 7 or later CentOS CentOS Linux 7.3 or later not supported 7 or later CentOS Stream 8 or later 8 or later 8 or later Oracle Linux UEK [1] 7.3 or later 7.6 or later 7 or later RHCK [2] 7.3 or later 8 or later 7 or later Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or later 18 or later 16.04 - 20.04 SLES 12 SP5 12 SPR or later 12 SP5 Debian 9 or later 10 or later 9 and 10 Amazon Linux 1, 2 Since 2018 1, 2 Amazon Linux 2023 all versions all versions not planned Note For technical questions about the table above, contact us at [email protected] More info about each of the considerations: Java heap size (-Xmx) ZST is required for heap size above 2.5 TB. If you don’t require heap sizes above 2.5 TB, you should try running without ZST if your operating system supports it. Note From Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07 to 20.03, the max heap size without ZST is 1 TB. As of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04, the max heap size without ZST is 2.5 TB. Operating system version Using Azul Platform Prime without ZST requires the memfd_create(2) system call. This system call is available since mainline Linux 3.17. If you want to run Azul Platform Prime on an older operating system, you will have to use ZST. If your operating system supports running without ZST, you should try it. See System Requirements to verify minimum OS version requirements for Azul Platform Prime without ZST. See System Tools Requirements for minimum OS requirements for Azul Platform Prime with ZST. Large Pages For large heaps in the range of 100 GB or more, large memory pages (2 MB) are recommended to increase throughput performance and JVM start time. Most modern operating systems can meet this need with Transparent Huge Pages. If your application sees reduced throughput or JVM start time when you test with Azul Platform Prime without ZST, try using THP. If you find yourself in this situation and your operating system doesn’t support Transparent Huge Pages, then you can run Azul Platform Prime with ZST as ZST implements a more efficient memory manager for large pages than standard Linux and is recommended in these situations. See Enabling Huge Pages for more info. Reserved memory for your Java applications on Azul Platform Prime ZST can be used in reserve-at-config mode which reserves memory exclusively for use by Azul Zulu Prime JVM java process. Other processes using memory on the server will not be able to unexpectedly use up available memory on the host and impact your Azul Zulu Prime JVM application launches. An added benefit is the predictable application start time as you do not depend on Linux memory management at process start time when using ZST with \"reserve-at-config\". If you need to worry about other processes that might get run on the same host, you may prefer to use ZST to guarantee memory is always available for the Azul Platform Prime instances. If you don’t need to worry about other processes on the host, and the application is rarely restarted, this may be less of a concern for you and you may be fine without ZST, or with ZST using reserve-at-launch if ZST is used for other reasons. See Configuring Zing Memory with ZST for more info. If you don’t use ZST, here are some things you should consider and configure if needed: Enabling Huge Pages. For large heaps in the range of 100 GB or more, large memory pages (2 MB) are recommended to increase throughput performance and JVM start time. This can be enabled on all current modern operating systems. Increase vm.max_map_count If you still have questions about ZST and non-ZST mode, please contact us at [email protected]."

ZST 5.22.3 provides support for Linux kernel versions 4.19.x. 5.22.2 ZST 5.22.2 introduces support for Linux kernel versions 4.18.x. 5.22.1 ZST 5.22.1 introduces a -e zing-ps command-line option for printing information about a new memory pool planned for future versions of Zing Virtual Machine. See the Zing User’s Guide for details. Cgroup controls are disabled by default in ZST 5.22.1. See the Zing User’s Guide for details. 5.21.8 ZST 5.21.8 introduces support for Linux kernel versions 4.18.x. 5.21.7 No new features are released in 5.21.7.

Miscellaneous performance improvements are included. 5.21.2 ZST 5.21.2 introduces support for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. ZST 5.21.2 provides support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3. ZST 5.21.2 no longer supports Ubuntu 12.04. 5.21.1 ZST 5.21.1 introduces support for Linux kernel 4.15.x. Support for control groups (cgroups) to favor memory limits on RHEL 7.x. 5.21.0 ZST 5.21.x includes an installation behavior change that automatically configures Zing memory as part of the ZST install. This eliminates the need to run system-config-zing-memory after the ZST install. When the ZST is installed, the default for the configuration policy is reserve-at-launch – System Zing memory will only be reserved when a ZVM process starts. If you normally configure System Zing memory using the reserveat-config policy to guarantee that the memory is reserved at the time of the configuration, then you will need to run system-configzing-memory and select the reserve-at-config policy. Be certain that you select whether you want to use percentages of total system memory or specific amounts of memory because the defaults have changed. For the reserve-at-launch policy, specify overall upper limit ofSystem Zing memory use by all ZVM processes running on the system. The reserve-at-launch policy allows you to specify amounts of memory for Reservable, Contingency and Pause Prevention that might add up to greater than 100% of the memory available on the machine. The limit on overall System Zing memory use puts an upper bound on the sum of all System Zing memory use. New format and contents for the pmem.conf config file for both types of configuration policy, reserve-at-config and Elastic Zing Memory (reserve-at-launch). 5.20.8 No new features are released in 5.20.8. Miscellaneous performance improvements are included. 5.20.7 ZST 5.20.7 provides support for control groups (cgroups) to favor memory limits on RHEL 7.x. ZST 5.20.7 comes with more aggressive mode of memory allocation that may involve flushing disk caches if there is lack of memory. 5.20.6 No new features are released in 5.20.6. Miscellaneous performance improvements are included. 5.20.5 ZST 5.20.5 provides compatibility with the newly available fixes for the recently reported Intel CPU kernel side-channel security flaws, and is required for Zing to operate on Linux distributions that have been updated to address these flaws with the addition of KPTI (kernel page table isolation). It is recommended to upgrade your ZST to ZST 5.20.5 or higher as soon as possible. With ZST 5.20.5, you can switch to a supported kernel without reinstalling the ZST package. Use notes: This enhancement doesn’t include support for kernels with same ABI version . It also doesn’t affect DKMS packages. This enhancement doesn’t work for major OS upgrades, for example, RHEL6 to RHEL7 Additional support for the following operating systems: Ubuntu 16.04 SLES 12, SLES 11 SP4 Oracle Linux 6, 7 Amazon Linux RHEL/CentOS 7 5.20.4 Added support for 4.7.3 CoreOS. 5.20.3 Additional support for the following operating systems: Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 Oracle Linux 6, 7 Amazon Linux Debian Stretch 5.20.2 ZST 5.20.x running ZVM 17.06.1.0 and later implement a behavior change for the default memory reservation policy. Previously, the default at the time of memory configuration was for all requested memory to be pre-allocated (reserve-at-config) at the time of configuration and, naturally, ahead of JVM startup. For the version of Zing (ZST and ZVM) downloaded from the free trial website, the default has been changed to not reserve the memory during the memory configuration but at ZVM startup. When installing ZST 5.20.* using RPM and DEB packages, the Zing memory needs to be configured manually upon installation by running \"system-config-zing-memory.” The following table shows the list of the packages that require manual memory configuration and the packages that have reserve-at-launch memory preconfigured during the installation. Operating System Package Zing Memory Configuration RHEL5, OEL5 (RHEL5), RHEL6, RHEL6 MRG (RHEL6), Amazon Linux (RHEL DKMS), DEB DKMS, SLES DKMS, RHEL DKMS. manual configuration after installation OEL6, RHEL7, OEL7, SLES11 SP4, SLES12, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04. reserve-at-launch configuration during installation 5.20.1 ZVM 17.06.1.0 and higher together with ZST 5.20.x includes an installation behavior change whereby default Zing memory is allocated at JVM startup (reserve-at-launch) as opposed to prior releases where memory is all pre-allocated (reserve-at-config) ahead of JVM startup. If your normal operational use of Zing requires pre-allocated memory, then be sure to reset the policy to reserve-at-config. 5.20.0 Additional support for the following operating systems: Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, and 16.04 SLES 11 SP4 and SLES 12 SP1 Oracle Linux 6, 7 Amazon Linux 5.19.0 No new features are released in 5.19.0.

Miscellaneous performance improvements are included. 5.16.1 Additional support for the following operating systems: Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, and 16.04 SLES 11 SP4 and SLES 12 SP1 Oracle Linux 6 and 7 RHEL/CentOS 7.3 5.16.0 Adding the Reference field to the license file: REFERENCE: <TEXT> This field enables entering key-specific text values. Fix for the zing-ps command 5.15.2 No new features are released in 5.15.2. Miscellaneous performance improvements are included. 5.15.1 Additional support for the following operating systems: Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, and 16.04 SLES 11 SP4 and SLES 12 SP1 Oracle Linux 6 and 7 5.15.0 More supported kernels for Oracle Linux 5, Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, SLES 11 SP4, and SLES 12 SP1. 5.14.0 Enabled building of Oracle 6 and 7 ZPG packages. More supported kernels for Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, and SLES 11 SP4. Newly added support for SLES 12 SP1. 5.12.0 Extended support for Ubuntu 16.04. Support for additional kernels for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 12.04. 5.11.1 Newly added support for Ubuntu 16.04. Support for additional kernels for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 12.04. 5.11.0 The newly introduced --batch-mode option of the zingzst.shutdown command enables uninstalling ZST without user interaction. Newly added support for SLES 11 SP4. Wide range of the supported kernels for Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 12.04 Support for Debian Jessie (DKMS only). Documentaion Change: All information about Zing system requirements, ZVM and ZST version compatibility, and Zing ZST API versions is now added to the separate document.

  "content" : "Recommended Configuration Note These prerequisites are only applicable to the Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) running with Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST). While Azul Zulu Prime JVM with ZST runs fine with certain default system settings, there are default OS settings that can cause response time sensitive applications to experience multi-hundred-of-millisecond stalls regardless of the JVM. Since Azul Zulu Prime JVM tends to eliminate or dramatically reduce JVM-related stalls, these remaining OS related stalls will tend to dominate the worst-case latency behavior of applications. It is therefore highly recommended that the following settings be applied. To ensure that OS settings are appropriate for performance sensitive applications, apply the following settings. SWAP Settings vm.min_free Settings vm.zone_reclaim_mode Settings Transparent HugePages Settings If you are using a Nehalem power efficiency chip set in the latency-sensitive systems, you might need to disable the Intel idle driver. Note Installing ZST will cause a kernel panic if you are using Ice Lake hardware with 5-level paging. Use 4-level paging or disable ZST with this release."

Perform the following steps to install and configure ZST: Login to your system as root administrator or use sudo. Download ZST installation package to your system <zst_install> directory. If you have installed Azul Platform Prime from the package repository, skip this step. The zing-zst package contains the kernel module and various tools.

This eliminates the need to run system-config-zing-memory after the ZST install. When the ZST is installed, the default for the configuration policy is reserve-at-launch – System Zing Memory will only be reserved when a Azul Zulu Prime JVM process starts. If you normally configure System Zing Memory using the reserve-at-config policy to guarantee that the memory is reserved at the time of the configuration, then you will need to run system-config-zing-memory and select the reserve-at-config policy. Be certain that you select whether you want to use percentages of total system memory or specific amounts of memory because the defaults have changed. The following table shows the list of the packages that have reserve-at-launch memory pre-configuration during the installation of ZST 5.21.x.

  "content" : "Azul Zulu Prime System Tools Post Installation Tasks The following post-installation steps are not directly required when starting to use Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) with Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST), but it is recommended to go through them to avoid later problems in production systems. Transferring JDK Customizations If you have applied customizations to the existing non-ZST Azul Platform Prime installation location, you might need to transfer those to the new installation location. Those customizations could be, for example, JAR files added to the directory $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext or changes in the security settings below $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security. Azul Platform Prime offers the same directories to store custom jar files and security policies. Setting an Unlimited ulimit Ensure the ulimit is unlimited for virtual memory, resident memory, and core file size. At the command line, type:  ulimit -v unlimited -m unlimited -c unlimited Some operating systems default the ulimit to -v unlimited, others do not. The -v unlimited value is required prior to launching a Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance for the first time. The -m and -c options issue warnings and do not prevent a Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance from launching. Set the ulimit prior to launching any Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances or add it to a system start command file. Ensuring Sufficient Virtual Memory Areas If you are running Oracle HotSpot or OpenJDK and using XX:+UseLargePages, you must ensure there is sufficient memory allocated to each: Azul Platform Prime and Linux memory. To ensure that OS settings are appropriate for performance sensitive applications, apply the following settings: Disable transparent_hugepages on your Linux system where you are running Azul Platform Prime. Turn off SWAP either by removing swap or by setting swappiness to 0`. Best practice removes swap. Set vm.min_free_kbytes to 1 GB or more. Best practice assigns more than 1 GB. Set vm.max_map_count=1000000. JDK Configuration Compatibility If your Java application requires access to any javax.crypto unlimited strength policy files: If they are included with your existing version of the JDK, copy them to the Linux JDK where the Azul Zulu Prime JVM software package is installed. If you do not have an existing JDK, download the javax.crypto policy files from the Oracle website directly and store them to the Linux JDK where the Azul Zulu Prime JVM software package is installed. Since Azul Zulu Prime JVM 17.11.0.0 the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) jurisdiction policy files are included. In order to use encryption with key lengths more than 128 bit, no installation of JCE files is required and adding the following line in your code is sufficient:  Security.setProperty(\"crypto.policy\", \"unlimited\"); With Azul Zulu Prime JVM 17.11.0.0 no additional encryption algorithm code was added compared to earlier releases, it only enabled existing code by default. The previous approach of copying the policy files is still available and all policy files for limited and unlimited key lengths are now included. To activate the unlimited key length:  cp /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/jre/lib/security/policy/unlimited/* /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/jre/lib/security/"

Since Azul Zulu Prime JVM 17.11.0.0 the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) jurisdiction policy files are included. In order to use encryption with key lengths more than 128 bit, no installation of JCE files is required and adding the following line in your code is sufficient:  Security.setProperty(\"crypto.policy\", \"unlimited\"); With Azul Zulu Prime JVM 17.11.0.0 no additional encryption algorithm code was added compared to earlier releases, it only enabled existing code by default. The previous approach of copying the policy files is still available and all policy files for limited and unlimited key lengths are now included. To activate the unlimited key length:  cp /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/jre/lib/security/policy/unlimited/* /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/jre/lib/security/"

  "content" : "If you have the Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) installed, you can configure the Zing Memory either by using the system-config-zing-memory wizard (see Configure Zing Memory for details) or by directly modifying the settings in the /etc/zing/pmem.conf file. To reload the modified settings, a restart of the zing-memory system service is needed. The restart is possible only when all Azul Platform Prime java processes are stopped. The following command checks for running Azul Platform Prime java processes:  $ zing-ps -s To restart the ZST zing-memory system service, use:  $ sudo service zing-memory restart The ZST can be configured in two different modes: reserve-at-config: the memory pool used for all Java heaps is allocated and reserved during the start of the zing-memory system service reserve-at-launch: the memory used for each Java heap is allocated at the time of the java process start. This behavior is similar to when using Azul Platform Prime without the ZST, which is possible since version 19.07.0.0 of the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. See a configuration example for reserve-at-config in file /etc/zing/pmem.conf:  # Memory configuration file version\nversion 2.0\n\n# ZST status (should always be enabled)\n# values: enabled | disabled\npmem enabled\n\n# ZST mode\nwhen-to-reserve reserve-at-config\n\n# memory reservations for ZST, all in percentage of system RAM\n# instead of % you can also use absolute values with unit specifier MB or GB\n\n# reserved memory for Java heaps, sum of all -Xmx\nReservable 68%\n\n# contingency memory\nContingency 4%\n\n# pause prevention memory\nPausePrevention 4%\n\n# use all NUMA nodes\nnodemask ALL See a configuration example for reserve-at-launch in file /etc/zing/pmem.conf:  # Memory configuration file version\nversion 2.0\n\n# ZST status (should always be enabled)\n# values: enabled | disabled\npmem enabled\n\n# memory cgroup enforcement\n# values: enabled | disabled\ncgroups disabled\n\n# ZST mode\nwhen-to-reserve reserve-at-launch\n\n# memory limits for ZST, all in percentage of system RAM\n# instead of % you can also use absolute values with unit specifier MB or GB\n\n# total sum of all limits\nOverallUpperLimit 76%\n\n# limit for sum of all -Xmx\nReservableUpperLimit 68%\n\n# contingency memory\n# here we reserve a static block of 4% of system RAM\nContingencyUpperLimit 4%\nContingencyMinimumFreeMemory 4%\n\n# pause prevention memory\n# here we reserve a static block of 4% of system RAM\nPausePreventionUpperLimit 4%\nPausePreventionMinimumFreeMemory 4%\n\n# use all NUMA nodes\nnodemask ALL To view and verify the current configuration settings, run the following command:  zing-ps -s This command also shows the current maximum available -Xmx value in megabytes.

For the reserve-at-launch mode, only the theoretical upper limit of -Xmx is shown in the UpperLimit row of the Reservable column as the practically usable amount can be slightly smaller depending on the current memory fragmentation of the system."

  "content" : "For the reserve-at-launch memory reservation option, Upper Limits are set to each of the System Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) memory pools used by the JVM. This includes the Java Heap, Contingency and Pause Prevention memory pools. When using reserve-at-launch, the Java Heap’s memory will only be reserved from the Reservable memory pool of System Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory when the process is launched. In zing-ps, if no Azul Zulu Prime JVM process is running then the Reservable used will be zero. Likewise, for the Contingency and Pause Prevention memory pools, when no Azul Zulu Prime JVM process is running the zing-ps will show zero memory use for both pools. When a Azul Zulu Prime JVM process is launched, a minimum amount of memory is reserved. This reserved Contingency and Pause Prevention memory is, in most cases, not used by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM process when it starts. In zing-ps, this reserved, unused memory is shown as free memory. If the Azul Zulu Prime JVM does use Pause Prevention or Contingency memory then the JVM will reserve that amount of memory plus an additional amount equal to the minimum free memory specified when the ZST was configured using system-config-zing-memory."

The output from the command then also shows that the zing-ps acct command has found one Azul Zulu Prime JVM Java process PID 15749 and gives the memory breakdown for that Java process. The table below takes a look at the example Fund Breakdown in more detail. The figures have been converted from bytes to megabytes (because it is easier to think about megabytes than large numbers of bytes). NAME BALANCE MAXIMUM fund[0]: Committed 7814 40582 The Committed Maximum is the maximum Reservable Heap The Committed Balance is the maximum Available Heap size for the JVM -Xmx command option; and if other JVMs have already been started this will be less than the maximum Reservable value. Java Process ID 15479 has been started and set a –Xmx of 32768MB reducing the Available heap from 40582MB to 7814MB fund[1]: Overdraft 2254 2254 The Overdraft is the Contingency Memory (using the ZST defaults, this is 5% of the Zing Memory) fund[3]: PausePrevention 2254 2254 The PausePrevention is the Pause prevention memory (using the ZST defaults, this is 5% of the Zing Memory) The sum of the Committed Maximum and the Overdraft and Pause prevention maximums is equal to the size of the Zing Memory (using the ZST defaults this is 75% of the available Operating System memory, leaving 25% for the Linux Memory). In this case 40852 + 2254 + 2254 = 45090MB from which we can infer that if the ZST was configured with a 75/25 allocation then the available Operating System memory at the time the ZST was configured was 60120MB (58.7GB). This can be useful to know; for example, if we made another assumption that this was a 64GB RAM machine, then 5416MB has been allocated away somewhere else before the Operating System was loaded – perhaps some DMA buffers for 10GBe NIC interfaces or some such. Example Memory Fund Allocation for a Process Carrying on with Memory funding details with 1 Azul Zulu Prime JVM process running, using Process 15479 for illustration. The table below takes a look at the example Fund allocation in more detail. The figures have been converted from bytes to megabytes (because it is easier to think about megabytes than large numbers of bytes). PID: 15479 /opt/zing/zing-jdk1.7.0_23-4.2.0.0.beta-14-x86_64/bin/java NAME BALANCE ALLOCATED MAXIMUM FND ODFND Account 0 default 326 2 328 0 1 The Account 0 value is in bytes, and it amounts to 328MB. Its max is equal to its funding (that is, the ALLOCATED plus the BALANCE are equal to max). Account 0 is used for some ZST-based memory stuff that is not purely in the heap (such as kernel structures for holding the kernel page tables and such). The JVM assigns 1% of -Xmx to Account 0, and the rest to Account 2 (both draw from Committed memory). Account 1 emergency_gc 0 0 0 -1 -1 Account 2 heap 29780 2660 34694 0 1 Account 2 is the Java Heap. If its BALANCE shows as negative, your application is using contingency memory. The Account 2 funding (BALANCE + ALLOCATED) together with Account 0 funding adds up exactly to the -Xmx value. In this case -Xmx ⇒ 29780 + 2660 + 328 = 32768MB The option flag -XX:JavaMemMax can be used to set the maximum for Account 2 (heap). NOTE: When -XX:JavaMemMax=<val> equals -Xmx<val>, then the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance is not allowed to use any Contingency memory. Account 3 pause_prevention 0 0 262144 3 3 The Account 3 MAXIMUM value for the pause_prevention memory computes to 256GB (exactly). Having a large MAXIMUM value doesn’t mean you have funding for that much. It just means you can draw up to that much total allocation (including dipping into overdraft accounts) if the ZST has resources to give you in the fund you are drawing from. In the case of pause prevention, a max of 256GB just means that this process can draw down the entire pause prevention memory if it wants to (it has zero funding for account 3, so all of that draw shows up in negative balances equal to the allocation level). The MAXIMUM values for each account are not funding numbers. They are just absolute limits on how much can be allocated in that account. This matters a lot when overdraft accounts are involved, as the MAXIMUM caps the total amount of allocation, even after the balance goes negative. The committed funding is always the sum of BALANCE + ALLOCATED, this remains true including times when the Azul Zulu Prime JVM dips into an overdraft account, such as contingency (the BALANCE will go negative at that point, and even though ALLOCATED is greater than committed funding, the sum is still equal to committed). The Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses Zing Memory only for the -Xmx (Java heap). So you need to leave enough Linux memory to accommodate not only the other Linux stuff that’s there, but also the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s C-heap."

  "content" : "Control groups (cgroups) is a Linux feature that provides a way of limiting access to system resources for processes when running applications. By using cgroups, you can limit CPU and memory resources. This setting only relates to memory limited cgroups, for example, those used by container environments activated by the --memory parameter to limit a container’s memory. The cgroups behavior regarding CPU resources is always enabled and behaves similar to OpenJDK. For the Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) 5.21.x release line starting with 5.21.7, cgroups support in Azul Platform Prime is automatically enabled when running on RHEL 7. It cannot be enabled or disabled manually. For ZST 5.22.x and beyond, cgroups support is disabled by default but can be enabled for all operating systems with the cgroups enabled line in the file /etc/zing/pmem.conf. After changing this setting, ZST needs to be restarted as follows: systemctl restart zing-memory. This makes cgroups behavior regarding memory limits similar to OpenJDK’s behavior. With cgroups support enabled, the JVM process will behave similarly to an OpenJDK process under cgroups control. If the process exceed the defined cgroups limit, it will be terminated by Linux. The only difference between Azul Platform Prime and OpenJDK is the availability of Contingency Memory and Pause Prevention Memory for Java applications on Azul Zulu Prime JVM. As soon as one of the two memory pools is used by Azul Zulu Prime JVM, the total heap usage exceeds the defined -Xmx limit. ZST memory configuration pmem.conf file defines by how much the memory usage can exceed the -Xmx setting. It is possible to set both memory pools to 0 (% of system RAM) for all Azul Zulu Prime JVM processes on that host or configure it individually per process."

  "content" : "Zing Memory Allocation Azul Platform Prime uses the Azul Zulu Prime JVM to run Java applications, similar to a typical JVM running a Java application. The significant difference is how memory is handled. Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses the Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) for managing the memory of three components: Contingency memory, Pause Prevention memory, and Zing Memory, the memory used for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Garbage Collector. Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM with the Garbage Collector and Con tingency memory means that your Java application is no longer limited to the maximum heap size specified on the Java command line when you started your Java application. As an additional resource, Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Garbage Collector might temporarily use Pause Prevention memory to prevent pauses that are caused by lack of available clean pages. See Understanding Zing Memory Use for additional information about how the memory resource is used and assigned in a Azul Platform Prime environment. Adjust the memory you configure to ensure you have sufficient memory to support Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances: Java heap use Reserved memory Note Using Azul technology, Java Application Execution uses all available memory without consequences common to tasks such as garbage collection and heap memory compaction. With Azul Platform Prime you can allocate 100 GBs of memory to easily and effectively enhance your enterprise production workloads."

  "content" : "Understanding Memory Allocation The Azul Platform Prime uses the Azul Zulu Prime JVM to run Java applications in the same way that other JVMs run Java applications. The significant difference between the Azul Zulu Prime JVM and other JVMs is the management of memory. The Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses ZST’s ZMM for managing memory for the three memory types that the JVM uses: Reservable memory, Contingency memory and Pause Prevention memory. This memory, called System Zing Memory, is configured when the ZST’s system-config-zing-memory tool is run. Memory for use by the JVMs running on the machine can be reserved at configuration (when the tool is run) using the reserve-at-config policy or the memory reservation for each JVM can be deferred until the launch of that JVM process using the reserve-at-launch policy. For the reserve-at-launch policy, upper limits are set for the amount of System Zing Memory to use for each of the memory types, Reservable memory, Contingency memory and Pause Prevention memory. For both configuration policies, at the launch of the JVM, the JVM requests the memory to reserve for its exclusive use as the process’s Java Heap. The JVM’s Garbage Collector manages Java objects in this memory. When free memory in the Java Heap is low, the JVM can use memory in the Contingency and Pause Prevention memory. When memory is first low, the JVM uses Pause Prevention memory to prevent pauses that could occur during a garbage collection when a thread tries to allocate an object but no free memory is available. Over the long term, if the JVM requires additional memory on an ongoing basis then memory from Contingency memory is used. This means that your Java application is no longer limited to the maximum heap size specified on the Java command line when you started your Java application. The following figures show the relationship hierarchy of the memory when the system has been configured using the reserve-at-config policy. Note that starting with ZST 5.21.x the default memory configuration has been changed when running the configuration tool In pre-5.21.x versions, the system-config-zing-memory tool configured the system by default with the reserve-at-config policy. When running the memory configuration tool for configuring memory for the 5.21 ZST, you must select which policy you would like to use. Reserve-at-config The Contingency Pool and Pause Prevention Pool are each 5% of the System Zing memory. Note that the configuration tool in the 5.21 version of the ZST uses percentages of the total Host System memory. When an Azul Zulu Prime JVM process runs, it reserves some of the Reservable Memory, based on the value of the -Xmx command-line option, as shown in the following graphic: Reserve-at-launch When a system is configured using the reserve-at-launch policy and no JVM instances are running, there is no System Zing Memory reserved on the system. Instead, the system-config-zing-memory tool only configures an upper limit on the amount of memory that can be reserved for System Zing Memory. If that memory in not in use as System Linux Memory then it can be used as System Zing Memory for Reservable memory, Contingency memory and Pause Prevention memory. In pre-5.21 versions of the ZST, only an upper limit is set. When a process is launched, memory is reserved for the Java Heap, the Contingency pool and the Pause Prevention pool. For the pre-5.21 versions of the ZST, all of the Contingency and Pause Prevention memory is reserved from the System Zing Memory. In the 5.21 version of the ZST, the only a small amount of the total upper limit of the Contingency and Pause Prevention memory is reserved from the System Zing Memory. By default, this is 200 MB. The ZMM strives to keep this much free memory available, even when a ZVM process requires some for its own use. When an Azul Zulu Prime JVM running in a reserve-at-launch configured ZST partition terminates, the System Zing Memory used by the JVM process for the Java heap is returned to System Linux memory as free memory. Any Pause Prevention or Contingency memory used by the terminating JVM is returned to the corresponding Pause Prevention or Contingency memory pool. If no other Azul Zulu Prime JVM is running in the ZST partition following the termination of the JVM then any Pause Prevention or Contingency pool memory reserved in that partition will also be returned to System Linux memory as free memory."

  "content" : "Pause Prevention Memory For other types of JVMs, when object allocation rates suddenly increase, the garbage collector can have a difficult time keeping up with the increased rate of object creation. The result is that other JVMs need to pause all work in the process to do a garbage collection. This causes Java application pauses. A common work-around to minimize the length of garbage collection pauses is to specify a small Java heap size – the theory being that a smaller Java heap requires less time to collect. Unfortunately, when the rate of work goes up, more live objects are in the heap when the heap fills up and the amount of time required for the garbage collection is proportional to the number of live objects in the Java heap. The pauses are still long. As part of the configuration of System Zing Memory, the system-config-zing-memory tool sets aside a percentage of the System Zing Memory for Pause Prevention memory. When there is a sudden increase in the object allocation rate, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance can use the Pause Prevention memory to efficiently keep up with and sustain the throughput during the heavy, unexpected workloads. Using memory from Pause Prevention memory gives the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance’s Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector additional time to adjust to and keep up with suddenly increased allocation rates. This ensures that the garbage collector does not stop or pause a Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running a Java application. Having Pause Prevention memory ensures that: The Azul Zulu Prime JVM delivers consistent response times even under sudden high loads. The Azul Zulu Prime JVM eliminates garbage collection pauses. Note Pause Prevention memory is used seamlessly by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM runtime and Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector algorithm. There are no settings you need to change or adjust. Using Pause Prevention memory is not a warning or error condition, and is not reported to or visible to you or the application."

  "content" : "Estimating Zing Memory Allocation Example The percentages used in the following example are based on the default values used by the system-config-zing-memory tool. The key relationship to remember is that the amount of Reservable memory in the system must always be greater than or equal to the sum of the –Xmx values of all concurrently running Azul Zulu Prime JVMs on the system. The maximum reservable amount of memory can be found using: reserve-at-config: ReservableMemory = Reservable_Total - Reservable_Used reserve-at-launch: We need to calculate the amount of memory available for System Zing Memory. We start by calculating the amount of System Linux memory left after the System Zing Memory configuration:  SystemLinuxMemory_InitiallyConfigured = HostSystemMemory_Total - Reservable_UpperLimit Find out if the system is using more System Linux memory than initially configured (positive if use is above):  SystemLinuxMemory_UseAboveInitiallyConfigrued =\n\n     SystemLinuxMemory_Used - SystemLinuxMemory_InitiallyConfigured Calculate the ReservableMemory  if (SystemLinuxMemory_UseAboveInitiallyConfigrued <= 0)\n\n   ReservableMemory = Reservable_UpperLimit - Reservable_Used\n\nelse\n\n   We have less memory available than the value of Reservable_UpperLimit\n\n   ReservableMemory = (Reservable_UpperLimit -\n\n      SystemLinuxMemory_UseAboveInitiallyConfigrued) -\n\n         Reservable_Used ReservableMemory The difference between the two formulas arises because the total reservable is fixed and pre-reserved when the reserve-at-config policy is used while there is an upper limit, but no pre-reserved memory, for System Zing Memory when reserve-at-launch policy is used. If using the reserve-at-launch policy, the Host System memory may not be available to use as System Zing Memory because it is already in use as System Linux memory. When estimating the amount of System Zing Memory to allocate, conscider: System Zing Memory = Reservable memory Contingency memory Pause Prevention memory Reservable memory = System Zing Memory – (Contingency memory Pause Prevention memory) Note All this memory can be used by a single Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance or multiple Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances. Maximum Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance heap memory (-Xmx) = System Zing Memory reserved for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM process use. Unused Reservable memory = Reservable memory – Sum of Java VM Java Heap memory (-Xmx) values for all currently running Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances Generally, to estimate the total amount of System Zing Memory needed, for each Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance that will be running concurrently, add the amount of Java heap memory (-Xmx) required; then add the memory required for Pause Prevention and Contingency memory (together, these are 10% of total System Zing Memory). For example: If you typically run 5 Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances and each will reserve 20 GB of memory using the –Xmx command line option then you need a minimum of 111 GB of System Zing Memory. 100 GB is used by all the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances and 11 GB is used for the Pause Prevention and Contingency memory. The following is an approximate breakdown of how the system’s memory is used when there is a single Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running. 100% Host System memory is shared between: 25% System Linux memory 75% System Zing Memory 100% of System Zing Memory is shared between: 5% Pause Prevention memory for Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector 5% Contingency memory 90% Reservable for Azul Zulu Prime JVM instances which is shared between: The reserved –Xmx amount of Reservable memory for each Java heap in each Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running For example, if total host system memory is 100 GB: 25 GB is allocated to System Linux memory 75 GB is allocated to System Zing Memory 7.5 GB (10%) is allocated to Pause Prevention and Contingency memory 3.75 GB for Pause Prevention memory 3.75 GB for Contingency memory 67.5 GB is available as Reservable memory Every Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running a Java application reserves memory from Reservable memory based on the value of the -Xmx command line option."

If this option is not set, the maximum is unlimited, though, in practice, it is limited by the size of the Contingency Memory. A larger Java heap Allows more objects to be created Takes longer to fill Allows the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance to run longer between garbage collections (GC) Consumes less CPU for garbage collection A smaller Java heap Holds fewer objects Fills more quickly Garbage is collected more frequently May lead to out-of-memory errors Consumes more CPU for garbage collection over time"

  "content" : "Heap Memory in 32-Bit vs. 64-Bit Systems Azul Zulu Prime JVM requires 64-bit systems. So, when determining the amount of Java heap memory to allocate, remember there is a difference in memory use in a 32-bit or 64-bit system. Java heap memory requirements for 64-bit systems are generally 1.5 times greater than 32-bit systems. Though primitives such as integers use 32-bit words on either a 32-bit or 64-bit system, Java object headers and pointers use 32-bits on a 32-bit system and 64-bits on a 64-bit system. The result is that proportionally more memory is used to accommodate the same number of objects on a 64-bit system. This applies to all Java environments, whether they are running JVMs from other vendors or an Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance. Additionally, the increased efficiency of the garbage collector on a 64-bit system, also requires additional space relative to a 32-bit system. So, when migrating a system from a 32-bit to 64-bit environment, the amount of memory has to be increased to achieve the same performance. An increase of 1.5 times can be used as a guideline, but should be evaluated versus your SLAs."

  "content" : "If you completed all the steps in Installing and Configuring Azul Zulu Prime System Tools, Zing Memory is configured with default settings. Default configuration sets aside 75% of the physical memory of your machine for use by Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) when you use the reserve-at-config policy and allows up to 90% physical memory use for Azul Zulu Prime JVM when you use the reserve-at-launch (elastic) policy. The Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) ZMM for managing memory for the three memory types that the Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses: Reservable memory – Memory than can be reserved by a Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance for its Java Heap. Contingency memory – Temporary memory to use when Java Heap memory is low – a shared system-wide pool of memory that any Azul Zulu Prime JVM can use when the original value of –Xmxunderestimates the actual Java heap use. Pause Prevention memory – A pool of System Zing Memory used to provide memory to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM when there is a sudden increase in allocation rates, The use of the additional memory ensures the application threads can continue to allocate objects while the Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector (C4) completes its work to free no objects that are no longer reachable. The memory for these pools, collectively called System Zing Memory is configured when the ZST’s system-config-zing-memory tool is run. Memory can be reserved at configuration when the tool is run by using the reserve-at-config policy. Alternatively, just an upper limit can be set and no System Zing Memory reserved when the tool is run by using the reserve-at-launch policy. In this case, the allocation of System Zing Memory is postponed until the launch of a Azul Zulu Prime JVM process For both configuration policies, at the launch of the Azul Zulu Prime JVM, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM requests that memory be reserved for its exclusive use as the process’s Java Heap – the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Reserved memory. The C4 collector manages Java objects in the Java Heap. When free memory in the Java Heap is low, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM can use memory in the Contingency and Pause Prevention memory. When memory available for object allocation is first low, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses Pause Prevention memory to prevent pauses that would normally occur when a thread tries to allocate an object but no memory is available. If the Azul Zulu Prime JVM requires additional memory on an ongoing basis then memory from Contingency memory is used. This means that your Java application is no longer limited to the maximum heap size specified on the Java command line when you started your Java application."

  "content" : "Memory Configuration with 5.21.0 ZST and Later Versions The system-config-zing-memory tool’s workflow is changed in the 5.21.0 ZST to support reserve-at-launch for all of the memory pools used by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM, Reservable, Contingency, and Pause Prevention. The workflow starts with a question that asks whether you want to configure memory as reserve-at-config (immediately as the tool is running) or reserve-at-launch (when the Azul Zulu Prime JVM process starts). Here is an example of the workflow: The first section is a description of what the tool does – configure your use of System Zing Memory and create a file with that configuration as: /etc/zing/pmem.conf.0  Welcome to the Zing Memory configuration wizard by Azul Systems.\n\nThis wizard sets up the Zing Memory configuration file\n\n/etc/zing/pmem.conf.0\n\nand initializes System Zing Memory. Read the man pages for zing, zing-zst, and zing-pmem-conf for more information about this configuration file.\n\nUse of System Zing Memory by Java processes running on the Zing VM requires you to configure memory in advance. This is analogous to reservation of memory for Linux hugepages, although System Zing Memory pages are not interchangeable with hugepages.\n\nFor most environments running Java applications on the Zing VM, Azul recommends setting up your system with an overall upper limit of 90% Zing Memory when using reserve-at-launch and a maximum of 75% when using reserve-at-config. The second section starts the collection of the configuration information. The first step is determining which memory reservation policy you want to use, reserve-at-config or reserve-at-launch. There is no default value, you must select one or the other. Here is the explanation:  Current task: Memory reservation policy ]\n\nYou can reserve all of the requested System Zing Memory during this\n\nconfiguration using the reserve-at-config policy or you can delay\n\nreserving the System Zing Memory for each Zing VM process until process\n\nlaunch using the reserve-at-launch policy. If you choose reserve-at-launch\n\nthen the amount of memory reserved in a subsequent step will be the overall\n\nupper limit available for all Zing VMs to use. The reserve-at-config policy will reserve the amount of memory you specify. The reserve-at-launch policy will prompt you for the UpperLimit for the amount of memory for each memory pool, Reservable, Contingency and Pause Prevention. You will also be prompted for an OverallUpperLimit. The following table highlights the four major configuration types for 5.21.0 ZSTs and later versions: Configuration Policy Specify Percentage of System Memory Specify Specific Amount reserve-at-config Must select percentage Default reserve-at-launch Default Must select specific Reserve-at-config with percentage of host system memory:  Which reservation policy do you want to use?\n\n** Enter reserve-at-(c)onfig or reserve-at-(l)aunch: c\n\n** Enter (s)pecific amount or (p)ercentage of system memory [default 's']: p\n\n** Enter Reservable memory as percent of system memory [default '68']:\n\n** Enter amount of Contingency memory as % of system memory [default '4']:\n\n** Enter amount of Pause Prevention memory as % of system memory [default '4']: Reserve-at-config with specific amount of host system memory:  Which reservation policy do you want to use?\n\n** Enter reserve-at-(c)onfig or reserve-at-(l)aunch: c\n\n** Enter (s)pecific amount or (p)ercentage of system memory [default 's']:\n\n** Enter amount of Reservable memory [default '<calc 68%>']:\n\n** Enter amount of Contingency memory [default '<calc 4%>']:\n\n** Enter amount of Pause Prevention memory [default '<calc 4%>']: Reserve-at-launch percentage of host system memory:  Which reservation policy do you want to use?\n\n** Enter reserve-at-(c)onfig or reserve-at-(l)aunch: l\n\n** Enter (s)pecific amount or (p)ercentage of system memory [default 'p']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Overall Zing Memory use as % of system memory [default '90']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Reservable memory as % of system memory [default '85']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Contingency memory as % of system memory [default '50']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Pause Prevention memory as % of system memory [default '50']: Reserve-at-launch specific amount of host system memory:  Which reservation policy do you want to use?\n\n** Enter reserve-at-(c)onfig or reserve-at-(l)aunch: l\n\n** Enter (s)pecific amount or (p)ercentage of system memory [default 'p']: s\n\n** Enter upper limit for Overall Zing Memory use [default '<calc 90%>']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Reservable memory [default '<calc 85%>']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Contingency memory [default '<calc 50%>']:\n\n** Enter upper limit for Pause Prevention memory [default '<calc 50%>']: As with the pre-5.21.0 ZST system-config-zing-memory, the tool will output a description of the actions that it has taken on your behalf.

  "content" : "This document describes how to configure and use Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) memory partitions on a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) server. A Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory partition is constructed using system memory from a single node or set of nodes. An Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory partition provides a JVM instance with the memory used for the JVM’s Java heap. Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions for the Java Heap Overview Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) implements a feature to support deployment of Java applications that require the performance and lower latency benefits provided by using a subset of the nodes (processor sockets and their associated memory) on a NUMA server. The Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions feature enables the creation of a single Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition or multiple Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions one of which supplies the system memory for a Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java heap. Together with the CPU and non-Java heap partitioning controlled by Linux command line arguments, you can now configure your entire Java process to use processing and memory resources local to a single processor socket or set of processor sockets. Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory partitions may span multiple nodes. A NUMA architecture server consists of two or more processor sockets where each processor socket is directly connected to its own physical memory. Each socket is interconnected with one or more sockets in a NUMA configuration and the server BIOS and Operating System (OS) are configured to support NUMA. NUMA Support must be enabled in the server BIOS and the Operating System (OS) for Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions to work. In a multi-socket system, the memory connected directly to a processor socket is referred to as local node memory. From that same socket, memory connected to a different processor socket is referred to as remote node memory. There is higher memory-access latency and lower memory access speeds for a core accessing memory on a remote node compared to accessing memory on a local node."

By default, this is Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0, as depicted as Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 shown in the One Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition Configured on Two Nodes figure below. On start-up of the Azul Zulu Prime JVM, without use of the -XX:AzMemPartition command line option, a Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance’s Java heap will use memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 which, with this configuration includes memory from all nodes. Because the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java Heap uses memory from all of the nodes, the overall memory access times and data throughput will be an average of the access times and data throughput you would obtain if accessing local or remote node memory exclusively. Default settings for the ZST Zing Memory configuration command allocate a default Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition with 75% of the available system memory (where the system memory is all of RAM on the machine). Example: A single Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition allocated across two nodes. 64 GB system memory with two 32 GB nodes, node 0 with 32 GB of memory connected to socket 0 and node 1 with 32 GB memory connected to socket 1 Command: Run the system-config-zing-memory command and accept all defaults. Result: Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 is allocated across Node 0 and Node 1 as illustrated below. The GC log files present metrics in the text format. See the following examples:"

Also, unless you specify a Nodemask to select the nodes that you want to use, then, the Zing Memory Partition will use the default value 'ALL' and use memory from all of the nodes. Setting Nodemask for a Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition The Nodemask is a hexadecimal value that corresponds to a binary value used as a bit mask to select a corresponding node or set of nodes to use as the source of the memory for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition. The default Nodemask is ALL. The default directs the ZST to create the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition to use memory from all nodes. For example, for a four-socket server, using the default Nodemask, ALL will be interpreted by system-config-zing-memory as the hexadecimal value 0xF, binary value 1111, and will create the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition with one quarter of the total memory request for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition coming from each node across all four nodes, 0-3. For an eight-core server, a Nodemask of ALL is interpreted as hexadecimal 0xFF, binary value 11111111. The following table provides examples of the mapping of hexadecimal to binary values; and binary values to the corresponding set of nodes. Hexadecimal Binary Nodes specified by Nodemask nodemask 0x1 1 Node 0 only nodemask 0x2 10 Node 1 only nodemask 0x3 11 Nodes 0 and node 1 nodemask 0x9 1001 Nodes 0 and 3 nodemask 0xC 1100 Nodes 2 and 3 nodemask 0xE 1110 Nodes 1, 2 and 3 nodemask 0xF 1111 Nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3 nodemask 0xFF 11111111 Nodes 0 thru node 7 Viewing stdout After Configuring and Restarting the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Service When you complete configuring Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions, restart the Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory service.

Adding this option can even reduce performance, see Azul Zulu Prime JVM Virtual Machine Release Notes for details. -XX:AzMemPartition Specifies Which Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition to Use for the Java Heap Use the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Java command line option, -XX:AzMemPartition, to specify to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM which Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition should be used as the source of memory for the Java Heap. -XXAzMemPartition=<num> - Where <num> is the number of a Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition that was configured using the ZST memory configuration commands. Memory Partition 0, which, when using the default configuration, uses memory from all nodes. A Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition uses memory from specific nodes. To make this memory be local node memory, you will need to start the Azul Zulu Prime JVM such that it uses the cores on that node. One way to do this is to use the Linux numactl command. If your Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition spans more than one node, then the Azul Zulu Prime JVM can be started to use the cores on all of the nodes that will be used for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Partition Memory. numactl Specifies Processor Socket and Node for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Process If you specify that a process should use Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory from a specific node or set of nodes then it makes sense to use the cores on those same nodes so that the memory will be the memory from local nodes. Using memory from local nodes for Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Azul Zulu Prime JVM and Linux Memory will lower memory access overhead and improve application performance. One way to do this is to use the numactl command with the --cpunodebind and` --membind` command line arguments. A Azul Zulu Prime JVM runs on Linux as a process. To run the Azul Zulu Prime JVM as a process on the cores on processor socket 1 (node 1 in the numactl nomenclature) and to use the Linux memory only from node 1:  $ numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=1 {javacommand-line-options} This numactl command uses: --cpunodebind=1 - To use only the cores in node 1. --membind=1 - To use Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 where we have previously configured Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 to use memory from node 1. The numactl command runs java with this Azul Zulu Prime JVM command line option: -XX:AzMemPartition=1 - To use only the cores in node 1. Assuming that the machine is configured as in Configuring Two Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions, if the -XX:AzMemPartition Java command line option is not specified then the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java Heap memory will come from both node 0 and node 1 because the Azul Zulu Prime JVM hasn’t been instructed to create the Java Heap using memory only from node 1. Example: Run on Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 (Default Configuration) Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0, when using the default configuration, uses memory from all of the nodes, so we do not need to use the operating system numactl command or the -XX:AzMemPartition command line option to specify that the JVM should use memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0:  java {java-command-line-options} Note that this is equivalent to:  numactl --cpunodebind=0,1 --membind=0,1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=0 {javacommand-line-options} Example: Run on Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 using numactl Assume that you have created a Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition named 1 that has been configured to only use memory from node 1. In this case, Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 needs to be specified by using the -XX:AzMemPartition=1 command line option; and because Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 uses the memory in node 1 then we need to use the numactl Linux command in order for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s process to run on cores in node 1 so that the Java Heap memory will be local memory. Likewise, we also want to use the numactl Linux command to use local memory in node 1 for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Linux memory. To do both of these, we specify that we should use the cores in node 1 with the option --cpunodebind=1 and specify that the memory in node 1 should be used for Linux memory with the option --membind=1:  numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=1 {java-commandline-options} Checking the Java Application After Startup Always check your Azul Zulu Prime JVM application after startup to ensure that it is behaving as you expected: Use top to be certain that it is running on the cores that you think it should be using. To view the individual cores in use and the threads executing, type in these options in the window running top: z 1 H Use zing-ps –s to be certain that it is running using the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Partition Memory that you think it should be using. Run numactl --hardware to view the “free” memory for the node that the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition is using; the free memory for that node should have been reduced by the same amount as the memory used on that node by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions."

One Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition uses memory from each of the two nodes One Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition uses memory from only one node This corresponds to the following two partitions and is depicted in the figure below: Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 8 GB from Node 0 and 8 GB from Node 1 Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 16 GB from Node 1 (the local node for the cores in socket 1) The number used for the name of the node and the number used for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition are independently specified. The node numbering is defined in the Linux OS. The Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition numbers are assigned by you when you run the system-config-zing-memory command. Therefore, in the above example, it is possible that Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 could be defined to use memory exclusively from node 0. Or in a four-socket server, Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 2 could be set up to use memory exclusively from node 3, if that showed the best performance when the application was benchmarked. Setting up Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 To reconfigure a system that has already been configured using the default configuration, first reconfigure Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0.

  "content" : "Running Azul Zulu Prime JVMs using Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions Azul Zulu Prime JVM does not support the -XX:+UseNUMA option yet. Adding this option can even reduce performance, see Azul Zulu Prime JVM Virtual Machine Release Notes for details. -XX:AzMemPartition Specifies Which Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition to Use for the Java Heap Use the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Java command line option, -XX:AzMemPartition, to specify to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM which Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition should be used as the source of memory for the Java Heap. -XXAzMemPartition=<num> - Where <num> is the number of a Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition that was configured using the ZST memory configuration commands. Memory Partition 0, which, when using the default configuration, uses memory from all nodes. A Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition uses memory from specific nodes. To make this memory be local node memory, you will need to start the Azul Zulu Prime JVM such that it uses the cores on that node. One way to do this is to use the Linux numactl command. If your Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition spans more than one node, then the Azul Zulu Prime JVM can be started to use the cores on all of the nodes that will be used for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Partition Memory. numactl Specifies Processor Socket and Node for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Process If you specify that a process should use Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory from a specific node or set of nodes then it makes sense to use the cores on those same nodes so that the memory will be the memory from local nodes. Using memory from local nodes for Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Azul Zulu Prime JVM and Linux Memory will lower memory access overhead and improve application performance. One way to do this is to use the numactl command with the --cpunodebind and` --membind` command line arguments. A Azul Zulu Prime JVM runs on Linux as a process. To run the Azul Zulu Prime JVM as a process on the cores on processor socket 1 (node 1 in the numactl nomenclature) and to use the Linux memory only from node 1:  $ numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=1 {javacommand-line-options} This numactl command uses: --cpunodebind=1 - To use only the cores in node 1. --membind=1 - To use Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 where we have previously configured Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 to use memory from node 1. The numactl command runs java with this Azul Zulu Prime JVM command line option: -XX:AzMemPartition=1 - To use only the cores in node 1. Assuming that the machine is configured as in Configuring Two Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions, if the -XX:AzMemPartition Java command line option is not specified then the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java Heap memory will come from both node 0 and node 1 because the Azul Zulu Prime JVM hasn’t been instructed to create the Java Heap using memory only from node 1. Example: Run on Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 (Default Configuration) Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0, when using the default configuration, uses memory from all of the nodes, so we do not need to use the operating system numactl command or the -XX:AzMemPartition command line option to specify that the JVM should use memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0:  java {java-command-line-options} Note that this is equivalent to:  numactl --cpunodebind=0,1 --membind=0,1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=0 {javacommand-line-options} Example: Run on Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 using numactl Assume that you have created a Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition named 1 that has been configured to only use memory from node 1. In this case, Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 needs to be specified by using the -XX:AzMemPartition=1 command line option; and because Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 uses the memory in node 1 then we need to use the numactl Linux command in order for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s process to run on cores in node 1 so that the Java Heap memory will be local memory. Likewise, we also want to use the numactl Linux command to use local memory in node 1 for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Linux memory. To do both of these, we specify that we should use the cores in node 1 with the option --cpunodebind=1 and specify that the memory in node 1 should be used for Linux memory with the option --membind=1:  numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=1 {java-commandline-options}"

  "content" : "Setting up Performance Testing This section describes an example performance testing scenario with a desired testing environment and how to configure Azul Zulu Prime JVM memory partitions within the testing environment. To run the system-config-zing-memory command you need root access permission on the server. Performance Testing Environment In this example, set up a system with three Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions so that you can compare the benchmark results for running the Azul Zulu Prime JVM when the memory for the Java Heap comes from node 0, node 1, or from both nodes. The scenario assumes that you will want to switch between the different memory configurations, trying different combinations of nodes, without needing to reconfigure the machine. Configuring the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions To accomplish this, create three different partitions on a system where 192 GB of system memory (RAM) are available on the machine. Overall, the machine will use 144 GB for Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory (75% of system memory) and 48 GB for Linux Memory (25% of system memory). To make the various configurations easier to compare, create three equally sized Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions, so each will be 48 GB. Test the following three configurations in which the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java Heap memory uses memory from: Environment Partition name Memory to use for Java heap 1 Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 node 0 and node 1 2 Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 node 0 exclusively 3 Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 2 node 1 exclusively The illustration below depicts three Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partitions configured on a server with 192GB of system memory: Running using the Configured Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition Following a reboot of your system, so that you can start each run with a known configuration, you can run the Azul Zulu Prime JVM using the memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 0 for the Java Heap and using the cores on processor sockets 0 and 1 and the Linux memory on nodes 0 and 1 with the following command:  $ java -Xmx40g {java-command-line-options} This is equivalent to the command:  $ numactl --cpunodebind=0,1 --membind=0,1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=0 -Xmx40g {javacommand-line-options} To run the Azul Zulu Prime JVM using the memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 1 for the Java Heap and using the cores on node 0 and the Linux memory on node 0 use the following command:  $ numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=0 java -XX:AzMemPartition=1 -Xmx40g {javacommand-line-options} To run the Azul Zulu Prime JVM using the memory from Azul Zulu Prime JVM Memory Partition 2 for the Java Heap and using the cores on node 1 and the Linux memory on node 1 use the following command:  $ numactl --cpunodebind=1 --membind=1 java -XX:AzMemPartition=2 -Xmx40g {javacommand-line-options}"

  "content" : "This section addresses the situation when Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) fails with one of the following error messages: Memory management: unable to fund java heap account ERROR: perror: az_pmem_reserve_pages (num2mPages … As these errors can occur when not enough free memory is available, i.e. other large processes are already running, first check with the command zing-ps -s and top if other Azul Zulu Prime JVM or other large processes are already running. If enough free memory is available as indicated by the Linux free command, then the cause of these error messages is often memory fragmentation. Azul Zulu Prime JVM needs large Linux pages of at least 2 MB page size and those might be too fragmented. If rebooting the system is not an acceptable solution in this case, upgrade to at least Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) 5.21.7 and add the following line to the file /etc/zing/drop.conf:  RESERVE2MB=true With this setting Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s enhanced Linux memory defragmentation is enabled to be able to operate under situations of high fragmentation. Note Do not enable the RESERVE2MB=true setting when running on Linux kernels older than 2.6.32-431. Due to a bug in those older Linux kernels, the system can crash (see CentOS bug 6660). Setting RESERVE2MB=true enables Linux memory defragmentation. This Linux function causes all processes on the host to stop for a few ms to seconds depending on the RAM size if defragmentation is triggered. When using this setting with the ZST mode reserve-at-config, the memory initialization and potential triggering of the defragmentation happens only during the start of the ZST system service zing-memory. It is safe to enable this setting there if you do not restart the zing-memory system service during the operation of other business applications on your host. Alternatively, you can run Azul Zulu Prime JVM without ZST (possible since Azul Platform Prime 19.07.0.0) or update your operating system to a version with Linux kernel 4.4 or newer, where the RESERVE2MB setting is not needed anymore. When enabling the RESERVE2MB setting in combination with the ZST mode reserve-at-launch, it can trigger the defragmentation potentially on each start of a Java process. Depending on the application use case, it is often acceptable, for example, if Java process starts occur during non-business hours only. With reserve-at-launch and the RESERVE2MB setting, there exists an additional small risk of triggering the defragmentation even during runtime of a Java process when it consumed all the available contingency or pause prevention memory and is requesting more. To prevent triggering the defragmentation during runtime, set the pause prevention and contingency memory pools to a static value, for example, each to 3% of the system RAM in the file/etc/zing/pmem.conf and restart the zing-memory system service:       ContingencyUpperLimit 3%\n     ContingencyMinimumFreeMemory 3%\n     PausePreventionUpperLimit 3%\n     PausePreventionMinimumFreeMemory 3%"

  "content" : "Working with Graphs The Garbage Collector Log Analyzer (GC Log Analyzer) offers more than 70 different graphs of log file data that provide insight into the behavior and performance of your application, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM, and the runtime environment. Most of the time, you need to quickly know whether the overall system is performing well. To accomplish this task, you can consult the required group of graphs that helps you visualize the GC activity and detect performance anomalies. Opening a GC Log File To open a GC Log file, specify the path to your GC Log file as an argument when starting the GC Log Analyzer (e.g., java -jar ./GCLogAnalyzer2.jar ./gc.log). Alternatively, run the GC Log Analyzer and use any of the following options to open your GC Log file: Select File > Open File from the main menu. In the dialog box that opens, browse for your log file and click Open. Drag your GC Log file and drop it in the GC Log Analyzer window. Choose Open Recent Files from the File menu to view files you’ve recently opened. Your GC Log summary displays. In the VM Process Info part of the log summary, hover your mouse over a JVM argument to view either the description of the option (highlighted with blue) or the note that the argument is ignored (highlighted with orange and crossed). Using the Graphs Window The Graphs window has groups that you can expand to view subgroups of graphs. To quickly search for a graph, start typing the graph name in the Graphs window. This expands all the groups, displays the search field and the graph. Use the Up and Down keyboard arrow keys to navigate through the graphs. To add a graph to your Favorite Graphs, navigate to the graph you want as a favorite and click the star in the top right corner of the graph. Select View > Graphs > Favorite Graphs from the main menu, to display your favorite graphs only. Using the Table View You can use the table view located below the Graphs window for displaying GC Log data in the tabular format for analysis. Selecting a line in the table displays the following: A red vertical line connecting related points on the graph below the table The data for the selected line under the minimized graph To display detailed information about each value at the bottom of the window, hover your mouse over the value. Using the Toolbar The toolbar at the top of the GC Log Analyzer window contains a set of buttons you can use to perform common tasks for every selected graph. Time selection (sec.): Allows to specify a time-based range in seconds to display in the graph window. View GC Log Summary: Provides a cumulative and structured summary of the data collected in your GC log. View GC Log: Displays a GC log in the text format, a graph in the pane below, as well as the selected line of a log at the bottom of the GC Log Analyzer window. Select Previous Item: Displays the previous element in the same series in your GC log. This option becomes available after you have chosen a highlighted line in the log or a dot on a graph. Select Next Item: Displays the following element in the same series in your GC log. This option becomes available after you have chosen a highlighted line in the log or a dot on a graph. Select Data Series: Allows to choose what data series to display on the current graph. Add Mark/Delete Mark: Allows to add or delete labeled marks applied to a log line or graph element. This option becomes available after you have chosen a log line or a graph element. Select Visible Marklines: Displays or hides all labeled marks you made in the log line or graph element. Export Current Graph to PNG: Saves a snapshot of the currently selected graph as a PNG image. Switching Between the Graph and Log Views You can switch between the Graph and Log views to work with your data. From Graph to Log To switch from the Graph to Log view, do either of the following: select a point on the graph and click the View GC Log button in the toolbar double-click on a point on the graph This displays the Log view with a highlighted GC log line that corresponds to the point selected in the Graph view. From Log to Graph To switch from the Log to Graph view, select a graph in the graphs tree on the left. Selecting Items on a Graph or in a Log When you click on a dot of a graph to select a corresponding event, an associated GC log line displays in the bottom window, and the numerical field that the selected dot is plotted from is highlighted. While viewing a GC log, you can click a GC log line to select it. This displays a thin red vertical bar on a preview chart to help identify the location of the selected line in the run. If the selected line is colored (i.e., it is one of the lines that chart data is extracted from), it is replicated in the bottom window that fits the entire line for easier analysis. Hovering a mouse over a numerical field in either presentations of the line reveals a descriptive tooltip. Zooming In and Out Rubber-Band Selection Position the pointer inside a chart, click and drag it in the direction from the top-left to the bottom-right edge of the chart. This enlarges the area selected with your pointer. Double-click inside the enlarged area of the chart to automatically adjust the Y-axis so that all dots of all currently visible lines within the currently visible time frame display. To reset zooming, click and drag your pointer in any other direction on the chart or double-click inside the selected portion of the timeline in the sliding bar. Range Selection To zoom in a specific time range of your graph, use a range slider below each chart to change a visible time frame. Dragging either of the slider handles represented by gray dots alters the beginning or the end of the visible time frame. You can drag the center of the selected portion of the time line to the left or right to change the position of the enlarged time frame and keep the width of your selection. Time Selection To precisely set a specific time frame for viewing in a chart, specify the start and end seconds in the Time selection (sec.) fields of the toolbar. Displaying Data in a Graph A legend at the bottom of every graph describes the names and colors of each series of data included in the graph. To display or hide a particular data series in the graph, toggle the items in the legend or use the Select Data Series button in the toolbar. To display your preferred units for the time when a GC event started or time elapsed since the beginning of a GC log in the chart, select View > Time Units from the main menu or click a little upside-down black triangle above the graph legend. The GC Log Analyzer uses seconds as default time units."

  "link" : "https://docs.azul.com/prime/GC-Log-Analyzer#understanding-a-garbage-collection-log-format",
  "content" : "Understanding a Garbage Collection Log Format A garbage collection (GC) log is a text file with the collected and written metrics of the garbage collector’s work produced by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The GC Log Analyzer extracts various JVM and system metrics from GC logs. Unlike logs produced by other JVMs, Azul Zulu Prime JVM GC logs contain detailed information not only about the GC process but about the system state as a whole. GC logs can be very helpful in diagnosing CPU and memory-related issues, as well as in optimizing application performance. GC log contents depend on the command-line options used to start the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Some details are available only when explicitly enabled with specific flags (see Garbage Collector Options in Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM Command-Line Options). The Azul Zulu Prime JVM uses an efficient, extendable text-based format to log events. Detailed GC Logging If detailed logging is enabled with -XX:+PrintGCDetails, very detailed and verbose information is printed to the log in a human-readable format that is NOT documented and can change at any time without notice. A detailed GC log reading requires a deep understanding of Azul Zulu Prime JVM GC internals and is mostly intended for Azul engineers to use. Regular GC Logging The most common practice is to enable non-detailed GC logging with -XX:+PrintGC -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps to minimize GC log file size, yet to get a lot of valuable information. The Azul Zulu Prime JVM writes GC logs very efficiently, so logging can be safely enabled even for low-latency production applications. GC Log Format The format of a GC log is universal. You do not need to know the whole range of possible fields to parse a log if you are familiar with the format. Example 1. Azul Zulu Prime JVM GC log line format  <date>: <rel_time>: [<ID> <value> … ] Where: (optional) <date> is an absolute time stamp of the logged event, enabled with -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps (optional) <rel_time> is the time passed since the start of the Azul Zulu Prime JVM in seconds, enabled with -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps <ID> is the identifier of a line type, it defines how to interpret data that follows <value> is a set of data fields, separated with a space, colon, or both Example 2. A GC log line  1.816: [OBJCREAT 33892 26764 18432 : 1.815713 ] The meaning of fields can vary in different releases of the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. To associate a field with its meaning, read a header line for a particular type of the line. Header lines are printed close to the beginning of the log and get replicated under some conditions (e.g., when GC log rotation is in use). The format of the header line is very similar to the data line, except that <ID> is appended with the H letter followed by textual field names. Example 3. A GC log header line  0.074: [OBJCREATH newGen(kB) permGen(kB) oldGen(kB) : end(s)] Some headers consist of two consequent lines. Example 4. A GC log two-line header  0.074: [TAGH Group 1 Group 2 : AnotherGroup]\n0.074: [TAGH field data data : data ] In case of two header lines, the first line denotes groups and the second line denotes names. A combination of group + name is guaranteed to be unique within the same line type. Unlike names, groups can contain spaces. Groups are divided by either a colon or two (or more) spaces. Example 4 above defines the following three groups and four fields:  Group 1/field\nGroup 1/data\nGroup 2/data\nAnotherGroup/data Although names of the fields can repeat (as shown in the example above), they are unique within the same line type in most cases. Names of the groups are guaranteed to be unique within the same line type. Note how Group 2 is aligned with the second data field. Below is a general rule for searching the index of a named field in a two-line header: Find the group part of an ID in the first line. Find the name part of an ID in the second line, starting from the position found in the first step. Example 5. Matching groups and fields  [ USEH memory disk ]\n[ USEH min max min max ]\n...\n[ USE 10 20 30 40 ] In Example 5, memory/min is the first data field (10), and disk/max is the fourth data field (40). Many fields, but not all of them, are named so that it is clear what units they are reported in (e.g., cgMem_max_usage_bytes or oldGen(kB)). Per-Thread CPU Utilization in GC Log The per-thread CPU utilization tracking feature (available from Azul Platform Prime 23.06.0.0) allows the collection and charting of per-thread CPU core usage statistics. This gives the ability to view the CPU usage of an application and JVM internal threads of the process over time. JVM internal threads are grouped into known categories (for example compiler or GC group) to make analysis of threads simpler. There is also an option to include CPU usage from other processes on the system. Per-thread CPU utilization is turned on using the option -XX:+PrintCPUUtilization, which is disabled by default due to the potential overhead from data collection. For options related to this feature, see Command Line Options. Parsing GC Log Data Please note that if you want to programmatically extract data from an Azul Zulu Prime JVM GC log, you cannot just grep for the line-type identifier and extract the N-th field. The order and position of line fields can vary in different releases of the Azul Zulu Prime JVM (e.g., a new field can be added to the middle of a log line). To retrieve particular log data, check out GC log headers to find the position of a required field and retrieve data from a GC log line based on the field index in the particular log. A script named gcLogScraper is provided along with the Azul Zulu Prime JVM installation (see Using Azul Zulu Prime JVM GC Log Scraper for details). The gcLogScraper script can be used to extract fields provided you know the fields names from a given log file."

A sample output on OpenJDK  [55.350s][info][safepoint] Safepoint \"CollectForAllocation\", Time since last: 553327366 ns, Reaching safepoint: 188921 ns, At safepoint: 94660058 ns, Total: 94848979 ns The log entry above shows -Xlog:gc,safepoint:gc.log output on OpenJDK with a pause of 94.848 ms at 55 seconds after application start. To extract the application stopped time from the gc.log written by OpenJDK or Azul Platform Prime, you can use the following shell command:  grep safepoint.*Total gc.log | sed -E 's/.*\\[([0-9\\.]+)s\\].*Total[a-z ]*: ([0-9\\.]+ [a-z]+).*/\\1 \\2/' Example output, with the 1st column showing the JVM uptime in seconds, the 2nd column the application stopped time:  76.810 0.0001696 seconds\n78.695 0.0001152 seconds\n82.780 0.0002665 seconds\n84.587 0.0002310 seconds This list of timestamps and stopped times can be loaded into a spreadsheet tool to create a graph. Alternatively you can feed it through a statistical analysis, as most often the percentiles are more interesting regarding application performance SLAs. Here an example to collect the P50, P99, P99.9 and maximum and skipping the first 60 seconds of warmup time:  grep safepoint.*Total gc.log \\\n| sed -E 's/.*\\[([0-9\\.]+)s\\].*Total[a-z ]*: ([0-9\\.]+ [a-z]+).*/\\1 \\2/' \\\n| awk '$1 > 60 { print $1,$2,$3 }' \\\n| datamash -t' ' perc:50 2 perc:99 2 perc:99.9 2 max 2 Output example:  0.0002 0.0034 0.0035 0.0160 Interpretation: 50% of all GC pauses are below 0.2ms, 90% below 3.4ms, 99% below 3.5ms and all are below 16ms. For Azul Platform Prime GC logs, you can also use Azul Platform Prime GCLogAnalyzer which displays performance-related metrics as graphs."

  "content" : "Using Zing Live Objects Zing Live Objects help determine the type of objects that are leaking while troubleshooting memory leaks. To identify and address a memory leak using information gathered in a Zing flight recording, complete the following steps. To create a Zing flight recording for inspection, use the following arguments:  java -XX:StartFlightRecording=disk=false,duration=<recording_time_duration>,settings=profile,filename=<recording_filename>.jfr The Flight Recorder has two configuration files: default and profile. To enable the Live Objects feature, you need to enable ZingOldObjectSample in the configuration file. By default, ZingOldObjectSample is enabled only in the profile configuration file in versions of Zing prior to 19.12.0.0. Starting with ZVM 19.12.0.0, ZingOldObjectEvent is disabled by default in all configurations. Note The JVMInformation, GarbageCollection, and OldGarbageCollection events must be enabled in your configuration file in order to analyze Live Objects in Azul Mission Control. The listed events are enabled in the default and profile configuration files by default. The profile settings may increase performance overhead due to collecting more data by the Java Flight Recorder. Customizing any settings file, either default or profile, may incur increased performance overhead. By default, the amount of live set events recorded by Java Flight Recorder is set to 99%. To decrease the recording file size, you can set the value of the JFRDescribeLiveSetPercentage command-line option to a number less than 99:  java -XX:JFRDescribeLiveSetPercentage=90 -XX:StartFlightRecording=disk=false,duration=<recording_time_duration>,settings=profile,filename=<recording_filename>.jfr When a recording is started, the output should look similar to the snippet below:  $ /home/username/<JDK_installation_path>/bin/java -XX:StartFlightRecording=disk=false,settings=profile,filename=myrecording.jfr\nStarted recording 1.\nUse jcmd 32747 JFR.dump name=1 to copy recording data to file. If just a filename without a path is specified (i.e., filename=<recording_filename>.jfr), the flight recording is saved to the directory from which you ran the command. To specify the path of your choice, use:  filename=<path>/<recording_filename>.jfr Once you create a Zing Flight recording, start the Azul Mission Control tool and open your Azul Zulu Prime JVM Flight recording from the File menu. If you do not have Azul Mission Control on your machine, download the installer file from Download Azul Mission Control and see Downloading and Starting Azul Mission Control for installation instructions if needed. In the Outline navigation tree, select Memory > Zing Live Objects to display the set of live objects captured in the recording. Study and compare GC cycles in the table with garbage collection identifiers (GC ID) for a live set suddenly increasing in size which indicates a memory leak. Live objects types marked during each selected GC cycle display in the table to the right when a specific GC cycle is chosen. Sort out live objects in a GC cycle by the total size to track the live object type with the biggest size and select a potentially leaking object type in the Referent column. All items that refer to a potentially leaking object type display in the Referrer column in the bottom table. The latter helps identify the source of the leaking object by reference count. (Optional) To retrieve more information, repeat step 5 if needed. When a potentially leaking class is identified on the Zing Live Objects sub-tab, use the Memory tab to get information about the allocation site. The Memory tab contains allocation sites, which lead to allocation in a new thread local allocation buffer (TLAB) or allocation outside a TLAB, sorted by type. Checking stack traces for a potentially leaking class can help to stop the real place in code where the leak occurs. In case the Memory tab does not help to find the leak, but the leak is still suspected, the Method Profiling tab might be used for this purpose. It is less convenient compared to the Memory tab, as it shows method calls of concrete types, not allocation sites. Usually, the Zing Live Objects sub-tab and the Memory tab are all you need to find a leak. Inspect the Stack Trace of your candidates to track where most memory allocation pressure comes from."

  "content" : "Introduction Azul Platform Prime MXBeans provide an interface to answer detailed questions about the behavior of your application and the Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM). The MXBeans are designed for both monitoring performance and extracting the low level details to discover the root causes of problems. To use Azul Platform Prime MXBeans, you will need to use the command-line option:  -XX:+UseZingMXBeans In order to compile code that relies on the use of Azul Platform Prime MXBeans, you will need to add the command line option to Azul Zulu Prime JVM javac command:  -J-XX:+UseZingMXBeans You can compile code that relies on Azul Platform Prime MXBeans with a javac from another vendor. However, you will need to add the ZingJMM.jar file to the classpath. For example:  javac -cp $(ZINGMXBEANSJMMJARFULLPATH) $(JAVA_SOURCE_FILES) Where the ZingJMM.jar file is at the following location, but can be copied to any convenient location for building your application:  $JAVA_HOME/etc/extensions/mxbeans/agents/ZingJMM.jar Note that Azul Platform Prime MXBeans .jar file should not be added to the CLASSPATH variable. Otherwise, ZingMXBeans methods return an exception when called. A program that is able to access the MXBeans and graph the collected metrics, such as JConsole, will aid in your ability to quickly understand the interfaces and their use. The available MXBean operations provide control of both the data collection and the JVM behavior. See ZingGCReporter for details of using Azul Platform Prime MXBeans when running on a Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Note that you might get an error message when permissions are insufficient to access the MBean server. If that’s the case, you will need to create or update a ~/.java.policy file and add the required permissions to it (see table below). When using a .java.policy file, ensure that you have an entry policy.url.2=file:${user.home}/.java.policy in the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security file. Azul Platform Prime MXBeans provide the interfaces that enable you to get the answers you need to understand your application’s performance. Flexibility in the management of the values stored as peak values and those available in accumulators makes it easy to tailor the collection of the data for efficiency and effectiveness."

  "content" : "Monitoring the Azul Zulu Prime JVM Using JMX and Azul Platform Prime MXBeans For those cases where you want to monitor the Azul Zulu Prime JVM in addition to monitoring the application, use Azul Platform Prime MXBeans. Primarily, the following are of interest for Azul Zulu Prime JVM monitoring: Java heap memory use Garbage collector activity: concurrent GC time and application stopped time For accessing the values for each of these attributes over time, use any JMX-capable systems monitoring tool or $JAVA_HOME/bin/jconsole. In JConsole, use the entries in its MBeans tab to access the Azul Platform Prime MXBeans and get a quick overview. Java Heap Memory Use Monitoring memory use is helpful to detect memory leaks or to collect statistics about the general memory use by an application. The latter can be used to correctly size the Java heap to be consistent with the application’s memory requirements. MXBean: com.azul.zing → Memory → Attributes: PercentJavaHeapOccupiedAfterCollection: The percentage of the heap in use after each garbage collection. The returned value is equivalent to the application’s current minimum memory requirement. It can also be used to detect memory leaks because consistently increasing values after full garbage collections create an easily seen pattern. It’s useful to set a warning threshold that triggers an alarm if the value exceeds 70% over a 5-minute interval, (though this threshold value depends on the live set size in use by your application). The value includes the memory in use for the Permanent Generation, a memory pool in the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java heap. ApplicationObjectHeapUse and ApplicationObjectHeapUsableMemory: The process’s current memory use and the total size of the application object area of the Java heap. The returned heap use value represents the current memory use of the New (also called Young) Generation together with the current memory use of the Old Generation. This metric is a refinement of the PercentJavaHeapOccupiedAfterCollection that removes some of the guesswork about the contributions of the other memory pools in the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Java heap to the application’s Java heap memory use. MXBean: java.lang → Memory → Attributes: HeapMemoryUsage (init, used, committed, max). Used for monitoring memory use by JVMs. For JVMs other than Zing, setting notification * thresholds can help monitor the JVM and application’s use of system resources. When using the Azul Zulu Prime JVM, the Java heap use between collections varies between a minimum of the live set size and 100% (or more). In other words, the Azul Zulu Prime JVM attempts to use a much of the Java heap as possible. Doing so extends the time between collections and lowers the Azul Zulu Prime JVM garbage collector’s overhead. Using a maximum use notification threshold value when running an application with the Azul Zulu Prime JVM that is less than 100% will result in spurious notifications. Garbage Collector Activity Monitoring garbage collector activity is useful for capacity planning. For instance, the activity level can be used to determine the CPU resources required to process varying application object allocation rates. Because that object allocation rate is proportional to the amount of work done by the application, the garbage collector activity can be used to determine maximum application workloads. Naturally, the Java heap size is related to garbage collector activity. Increasing the Java heap size can reduce the impact of sudden high garbage collector activity and the underlying high workloads. The latter are also seen as allocation rate spikes. MXBean: com.azul.zing → GarbageCollector → GPGC New → Attributes: PercentageOfTimeCollectorIsRunning: The ratio of the \"garbage collection time\" to the \"interval between end times of two consecutive collections.” The value is based on the most recent garbage collection and is not cumulative. The percentages are calculated separately for the New Generation collector and the Old Generation collector. A warning threshold of 30% over 5 minutes should be set to warn about over-use of available CPU resources by the garbage collector. This is most important metric for monitoring the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s garbage collector behavior because this metric is the first to increase in situations when the system’s capacity is nearing its limits. MXBean: com.azul.zing → GarbageCollector → GPGC Old → Attributes: PercentageOfTimeCollectorIsRunning: The same recommendations as for the New Generation collector, but for the Old Generation collector. Use the same threshold to monitor. The time for processing Permanent Generation objects is included in this metric. If you need more fine-granular monitoring, the following additional attributes provide more precise information about the garbage collectors’ behavior: CollectorCumulativePauseTimeSec: Cumulative garbage collector pause time. The typical length of time for each of these Azul Zulu Prime JVM pauses is in the range of single digit milliseconds or less. CollectorCumulativeRunningTimeSec: Cumulative wall clock time the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s garbage collector has been running in parallel with the application’s threads. During this time, more CPU resources are used because the garbage collector is running its own set of threads. The number of running garbage collector threads (for each of the New Generation collector and Old Generation collector) is based on the number of CPU threads (hyper-threads or just physical cores if the machine is configured with hyper-threading off). CollectionCount: Cumulative number of garbage collections since Azul Zulu Prime JVM start. MXBean: com.azul.zing → Time → Attributes: ElapsedTimeSinceJVMStartSec: Seconds since Azul Zulu Prime JVM start. Useful for time-base calculations with CollectorCumulativePauseTimeSec and CollectorCumulativeRunningTimeSec. Code Cache Memory Use MXBean: com.azul.zing > MemoryPool > CodeCache → Attributes: CurrentUse: Use of the memory pool where JIT-compiled code is stored. Useful to decide whether increasing the size of the code cache using -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=N (the default value is 10% of Xmx) is needed. CurrentSize: Value returned is the maximum size of the code cache. The value can be set by using -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=N (the default value is 10% of Xmx). Configuration To activate the JMX connector on the Azul Zulu Prime JVM and enable the Azul Platform Prime specific MXBeans, add the following command line parameters and configure them according to your system’s requirements (port and security options):  -XX:+UseZingMXBeans\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9001\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=true\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=passwordFile\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false The passwordFile contains two lines with username and associated password for read only access to attributes (monitorRole) and read/write access to methods and user functions (controlRole). Only change the passwords, not the usernames! Example:  monitorRole password1 controlRole password2 File permission to the passwordFile needs to be limited:  chmod og-rwx passwordFile To avoid connection failures over the JMX protocol on systems with multiple network interfaces or to connect to a container system, it is often needed to specify the RMI hostname and RMI port:  -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=HOSTNAME\n-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=9001 Where: for the RMI port, the same number as for the JMX port can be used for HOSTNAME, enter the IP address or hostname you would later use on the client side to connect to To improve security, please enable com.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=true."

The analysis can be repeated and affinities reset. The CPU time use collected for ach hread is cumulative. Monitor CPU Time Use - continuous process CPU time use snapshots + Continuous monitoring of each thread’s CPU time use and use of the data over a configurable, immediately previous interval to st the CPU thread affinities of each application thread. The analysis and setting of affinities can be continuous. ThreadOpt it disabled by default. You can enable it by using the -XX:+UseThreadOpt command-line option.

  "content" : "ZVision Overview ZVision provides programmers and deployment engineers with information about both a running application and the underlying Azul Zulu Prime JVM. It also helps users tune command line options and code to optimize performance using the following capabilities: Complete internal and environment settings inventory Statistical, flat profiling of processor core usage from the thread level to run-time tasks down to the method level Take two data samples within a period of time (for example, in a 20 sec. interval) to calculate performance counter increments. ZVision requires: JVM host IP address and JVM host ARTA port The Azul Run Time Analysis (ARTA) port is the application host port specified with the -XX:ARTAPort command line. ZVision host IP address and ZVision browser listening port ZVision is automatically installed on the same machine as JVM when JVM is installed. You can connect a ZVision installed on one machine to a JVM on another machine. The ZVision listening port must be configured. ZVision is accessible from supported Web browsers with access to the application host running the JVM instance. The supported browsers include: Microsoft® Internet Explorer 6 (or later) on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3 (or later) on all supported operating systems Apple Safari™ 2.0 (or later) for macOS Statistical Tick Profiler The statistical tick profiler displays how processor core time is spent between various software execution units (for example, threads, methods, and run-time tasks). The Azul Platform Prime tick profiler differs from other profilers as follows: It is a statistical, flat (not tree-based) profiler. It does not capture every processor core cycle. Instead, for every n processor core cycles, it records where in the JVM the processor core was running (this is the program counter). It then uses this data to build a flat, non-nested profile. The captured data represents a specific time period. It profiles both within and outside the Java code. Most Java profilers use byte code instrumentation for Java code. It does not profile when threads are blocked on locks. To retrieve information on monitors, go to the Monitors window. The statistical tick profiler is displayed in the Tick profile window accessed from the CPU tab. Enable or Disable Tick Profiler The Tick Profiler is enabled and disabled by using the Java command line option, UseTickProfiler. The default value for UseTickProfiler is false, which means the Tick Profiler will not collect profiling information. To enable the Tick Profiler, use -XX:+UseTickProfiler (set to true) To disable the Tick Profiler, use -XX:-UseTickProfiler (default, set to false) Sorting Tables Variable size tables can be sorted by column. Click the column head to sort in ascending order. Click the column head again to resort in descending order. Fixed tables (for example, the GC Summary Window) cannot be sorted."

  "content" : "Running ZVision Before you can use ZVision to view JVM data, you need to familiarize yourself with the specific Azul Zulu Prime JVM option, configure the JVM host port and ZVision server. Azul Zulu Prime JVM Command Line Options The Azul Zulu Prime JVM command line options listed in the table below are used to configure ZVision to provide profiling and diagnostics information when running a Java application on a Azul Zulu Prime JVM application host. Java Command Option Description -XX:ARTAPort={off|<port>|any} Enables ZVision and allows the ZVision server to listen on the specified port of the host where the JVM is running. Valid options include: off – disables ZVision (default). <port> – port number for ZVision to use on the host. The value should be greater than or equal to 1025 and less than or equal to 65535. any – ZVision uses any free port. This setting is useful when starting multiple instances of ZVision for multiple VMs. Supply a port number or set this option to any to enable ZVision. The ARTA (Azul Run Time Analysis) port provides internal API communication between ZVision and JVM. -XX:PrintGCHistory=<number of historical PGC cycle reports> Set the number of historical PGC cycle reports to save for display in ZVision (default =50). -XX:GCWarningHistory=<number of historical PGC warnings> Set the number of historical PGC warnings to save for display in ZVision (default =50). Configuring the JVM Host Port To configure ZVision on a JVM application host: Log on to the JVM application host where the Java workload will be run. Add the following Java command line option to your Java application launch command: -XX:ARTAPort=<port> where: <port> is the port ZVision server will use to connect on the JVM. The Azul Real Time Analysis port (ARTA port) provides internal communication between ZVision and the JVM. Download ZVTools From Azul Platform Prime 23.07.0.0, ZVTools is not included in the Azul Platform Prime package and must be downloaded separately. ZVTools distribution can be found here: https://ftp.azul.com/releases/Zing/ZVision/ZVTools.zip Configuring the ZVision Server The ZVision server is found within ZVTools.zip. The ZVision server does not need to be run on the same host where the application is running, it only requires a network connection to the host where the application is running. To set up the ZVision server: Locate the ZVision folder within ZVTools.zip Log in to a host where the ZVision server will run. Set the JAVA_HOME variable (or equivalent) so that the Java call points to the parent directory of the JVM software. For example: JAVA_HOME=<JVM install location>/<JVM top-level directory> Copy the contents of ZVision/bin and ZVision/etc to JAVA_HOME/bin/ and JAVA_HOME/etc/ on the host where the ZVision server will run. Type the following Java command line: $JAVA_HOME/bin/zvision -p <port> where: <port> is port number that is used by a browser to connect to ZVision (default: 8088) When the ZVision server starts successfully, the port number that is used by the browser to connect to ZVision is displayed on the command line. For example:  ZVision server listening on port 8088 Advanced Configuration Options The ZVision server can be invoked from the command line as follows: `zvision [options] ` The following command line options are supported: Command Line Option Description -h or --help Display a list of supported command line options -p PORT, --port=PORT Specify the port number port number that browsers listen to the ZVision server -i INTERFACE, --interface=INTERFACE Specify the network interface that the JVM accepts HTTP connections. -t ARTA_TIMEOUT, -arta_timeout=ARTA_ TIMEOUT Specify the timeout interval (in seconds) when communicating with the JVM. -1 DEBUG_LEVEL—logging=DEBUG_LEVEL Specify the debug logging level: debug, info, warning, error, or critical --document_root=DOCUMENT_ ROOT Specify the path to static HTML files used by the ZVision server."

  "content" : "Threads Tab Threads List Window The Threads List window displays all threads, status of each thread, and links to detailed information about a thread. View and action options include: Refresh this window to view thread progress. Click the Name and State column titles to sort the table. Click the Details link item display the status of a thread and where it is blocked. Refer to Stack Trace Window. Set values in the Name, State, Group, and/or Per page fields to filter the displayed list The following table describes the Threads List window elements. Elements Description Name Lists the name of the thread as assigned by the application. State The most common states for threads are: running – the thread is executing on a processor core. I/O wait – the thread is waiting for socket or file I/O. waiting on monitor – the thread is blocked in java.lang.Object.wait() awaiting notification. low memory detection – acquiring monitor – the thread is waiting to acquire a synchronization monitor. acquiring and releasing monitor – the thread a requires and releases a synchronization monitor. This typically happens when the critical section of the monitor is extremely small. sleeping – the thread executed java.lang.Thread.sleep(). Other states, such as idle, semaphore wait, waiting on JVM monitor Threads_lock, or Waiting on Monitor SLT lock indicate threads that are internal to the JVM. These states are not normally useful for analysis of application performance. Also, during start up, compiler threads may be running. The time (in seconds) that the thread has spent since entering the state is provided in parenthesis after the waiting state indicators. Details Provides links to a stack trace, tick profile, and object profile for the selected thread. These functions are the same as the regular tick and profile features, except that only information on the selected thread displays. The following links appear inline with threads listed in this window: Stack – displays a thread execution details window. Displays the page Threads > Stack Trace. Ticks – displays a per-thread profile. Displays the page CPU > Tick Profiler. System calls, RPC out, RPC in, FDC, and Transport are not supported at this time. Stack Trace Window The Stack Trace window lists all threads and displays whether a thread is executing or is blocked. This can help to determine changes to make in the application code. To perform a search by thread name, type a string in the Name field to display all thread names that include that text string (case sensitive). Click the thread links in the Stack Trace window to display a thread execution details window. Use the State drop-down menu to only display threads in a certain state (for example, running, I/O wait, acquiring monitor, and so on). Use the Group drop-down menu to select whether to list system, non-system, or all group types. Use the Per Page drop-down menu to determine the number of items to display on this page. Toggle between low or high display of detailed information. Refresh this screen to view the progress of the thread. Relevant information displays at the top of the window: Address Priority Object blocked Object wait CPU wait I/O wait The Stack Trace window is displayed only if it is enabled in the Features window. Deadlocks Window The Deadlocks window lists detected deadlock cycles. Threads involved for each cycle of locks are listed with the monitor type the thread is trying to acquire and the thread that is the current owner. Click the thread links to view additional information. Contention Window The Contention window provides statistical information for each monitor and sorts monitors by total acquire time. The following types of monitors appear in the Contention window: Java-level monitors – identified by their class name. Internal JVM monitors – identified with the extension _lock. If there are a high number of internal JVM monitors, examine the verbose garbage collection (GC) logs. Observe if there are a large number of GC pauses. Contact Azul customer support if this becomes a problem. The total acquire time parameter is the time, in milliseconds, for acquires to occur for a given internal or Java-level monitor. The following table describes the Contention window elements. Click column titles to sort by relevance. Elements Description Name The name of the monitor. Acquire Time (ms) Total – the time, in milliseconds, for acquires to occur for a given internal or Java-level monitor (not tracked for lightly contended “thin” monitors). Max (ms) – the maximum time, in milliseconds, to perform an acquire. Blocking acquires Count – the number of blocking acquires. Waits Count – the number of wait cycles on the thread. Max (ms) – the maximum time, in milliseconds, of wait cycles that are allowed. Total (ms) – Cumulative wait cycle in milliseconds Contention Details Window The Contention Detail window provides additional information about the selected monitor in contention. Detail information is displayed through the Azul Support tab. Note If Azul Support is enabled, links to related Monitor details are displayed. Only enable and use the Azul Support tab as directed by Azul Support team members. CPU Tab The CPU tab provides information about how much CPU time is being used by threads. This is measured by recording the length of time it takes a thread to complete a tick, how often a thread accesses sensitive areas of the application code, and the length of time a thread takes to achieve a safepoint. Note Method names in the tick profiler are compiled methods and are no longer being interpreted. All time spent by methods being interpreted is summed as one entry named “Interpreter.” Check the Tick Profile window for functions such as VM_C2 Compiler or Interpreter after launching an application. If these functions are high on the list, then the application is still starting up (a warning message may also appear in the Compiler tab). To determine if the application is warmed up, wait a few seconds, click Reset Tick Profile, then refresh the Web browser until these two threads are not high in the list. The following table describes the Tick Profile window elements. Element Description Pause/Resume the Tick Collection Click Pause The Tick Collection to stop refreshing the list of ticks. This is useful when you need to locate a specific item in a rapidly changing list. Click Resume The Tick Collection and refresh the screen to continue updating the list of ticks. Reset Tick Profile Clears the existing list of ticks and restarts tick collection. Cutoff Filters the list of ticks to list only those values that are greater than or equal to the set cutoff value. Enter value. Click Submit. Below Cutoff At the bottom of the list of ticks, it lists the percentage and number of ticks that are not included in the displayed list as defined by the Cutoff percent value and Threads value. Threads Display the ticks for only the threads listed in this field. Enter value. Click Submit. None, JVM, All The three radio buttons filter the tick data by a tag assigned to it. Whenever a thread is running, it has a current tag assigned to it. That value can change at any time, as the thread does different things. For instance, if you have a thread that is a garbage collection thread, it’s tag might be \"garbage collection\" most of the time, but when that thread was running some specific subtask of GC, it might say GC marking phase. This feature allows collates and displays the data from the aspect of the tag value instead of the method name. The options are: None – don’t filter the list by tags. JVM — group all the JVM compiler ticks into one entry, so that everything is lumped together. Useful if you are trying to get a sense of what overhead the compiler is having. All - only display ticks by tag type for all threads. Instead of showing ticks entries by their method name, group and display them by their tag type. To apply tag filter, click a radio button. Click Submit. Percent The percentage of CPU resources (% of the total number of ticks collected during the collection period) the function used during the time interval. Ticks The number of program counters (“ticks”) collected in the time interval. This includes: Timer ticks – collect for each tick, the thread ID, CPU, stack trace and last eight calling functions when the tick occurs. The time reported, in milliseconds, is thread time, not clock time. Time to safe point ticks – collect the time required to complete a save point process. Source A description of the function being counted. The following are definitions for specific functions: VM_GC Task – the garbage collector for the JVM. ARTA_Performance_Monitor – the function that collects and displays ZVision data. VM_C2 Compiler – the JVM JIT compiler compiling methods indicating that an application is still warming up . generate_monitor enter – the amount of time spent busy-waiting to acquire monitors. Event Profiling Tick Buffer Statistics Statistical information about the total list of ticks. This includes: Ticks within a Buffer – number of ticks a standard tick buffer can hold. There is a fixed maximum of 2K. Available Buffers – number of buffers the user has allocated, as determined by the -XX:EventTickBufferDataBufferMargin=N value, plus the high water mark number of active threads. For example, if you specify 100, and the application has 400 threads simultaneously active, then there are 500 available buffers. This total value is dynamic, but only grows. If suddenly the application drops 300 threads, there continues to be 500 buffers. Theoretical Maximum Ticks (Available Buffer * Ticks/Buffer) – per the listed formula, for example using Ticks within a Buffer maximum (2000) X Available Buffers (500) = 1,000,000. Count of Ticks processed – not all buffers are completely filled at any moment in time. The tick buffers are collecting ticks. Some have not been used yet. This value is the count of all ticks that are in buffers, which is some value less than the theoretical maximum. Profiler Ticks applicable (matched filter criteria) – number of ticks that match the search criteria Other Ticks not applicable (Failed filter criteria) – number of ticks that do not match the search criteria. Profiler Ticks and Other Ticks equal the total number of ticks processed. Meta Ticks Window Meta Ticks measure how long it takes to perform a function. This is not a measure of each thread. Meta Ticks are like timer ticks in nature. They are a discreet packet of information about the state of a thread, but unlike the Profile Ticks, which are created based on some periodic timer, Meta Ticks are created as the thread enters certain specific code paths. The following table describes the Meta Ticks window elements. Element Description Pause/Resume the Tick Collection Click Pause The Tick Collection to stop refreshing the list of ticks. This is useful when you need to locate a specific item in a rapidly changing list. Click Resume The Tick Collection and refresh the screen to continue updating the list of ticks. Reset Tick Profile Clears the existing list of ticks and restarts tick collection. Search Criteria: Single Value Entries Entries Displayed – number of entries displayed on a given page. Tick Start – a search field which determines the earliest tick that is included in the display, based on the elapsed tick counter. Tick End – a search field which determines the latest tick that is included in the display, based on the elapsed tick counter. Search Criteria: Comma Separated Lists These items are all search criteria for metaticks. The five fields in this row can all use comma separated lists as a search criteria. That is, you can search for more than one term simultaneously, by listing those terms with commas separating them. For example, CPU field could contain \"2,5,9\", which would list all metaticks that came from CPU 2, 5 or 9. MetaTick # – value that can be used for searches. The values are preassigned by Azul. User Info # – value assigned dynamically by the application that can be searched on. Tag # – The current Virtual Machine Process Tag of the thread when the metatick occurred. This is a pre-defined value we assign to a thread that can be changed dynamically, to indicate what kind of work the thread is doing. The values are preassigned by Azul. CPU # – the CPU that the thread was executing on when the metatick occurred. Thread # – thread ID for Azul internal use. Data Table List of actual metatick data. See below listed field descriptions. Line item – last 100 meta ticks recorded. Tick Counter – elapsed ticks since startup. Thread ID – thread ID for Azul internal use. CPU – CPU that the thread was executing on when the metatick occurred. MetaTick Type – value for Azul internal use. Value indicates the tag value at the time the tick occurred. MetaTick Type # – string translation of the stored bit value to the metatick type. Tag Name – string human readable translation of the tag number. Tag # – the VM Tag currently assigned when the metatick occurred Stack Frame Address – address of the stack frame at the time the tick occurred. Event Profiling Tick Buffer Statistics The following are diagnostics related to capturing tick statistics. Ticks within a Buffer – number of ticks a standard tick buffer can hold. There is a fixed maximum of 2K. Available Buffers – number of buffers the user has allocated, as determined by the -XX:EventTickBufferDataBufferMargin=N value, plus the high water mark number of active threads. For example, if you specify 100, and the application has 400 threads simultaneously active, then there are 500 available buffers. This total value is dynamic, but only grows. If suddenly the application drops 300 threads, there continues to be 500 buffers. Theoretical Maximum Ticks (Available Buffer * Ticks/Buf) – per the listed formula, for example using Ticks within a Buffer maximum (2000) X Available Buffers (500) = 1,000,000. Count of Ticks processed – not all buffers are completely filled at any moment in time. The tick buffers are collecting ticks. Some have not been used yet. This value is the count of all ticks that are in buffers, which is some value less than the theoretical maximum. Profiler Ticks applicable (matched filter criteria) – number of ticks that match the search criteria Other Ticks not applicable (Failed filter criteria) – number of ticks that do not match the search criteria. Profiler Ticks and Other Ticks equal the total number of ticks processed. Event Tracker This feature is not supported.

Allocated Objects Window Data collected for allocated objects only when the -XX:ProfileAllocatedObjects option is included in the JVM command. This feature is not supported. Live Objects Window The Live Objects window displays a current list of classes in the old generation heap that are being kept alive. Use this information to identify possible memory leaks in your Java application. Each listed row [with a plus (+)] is a referent class. Expanded rows show a list of referrer classes to the referent class. A class is listed as a referrer, when all the following conditions are met: An object of that class directly points to an object of the referent class. The referent object was seen by the GC through the referrer object. Only the first referrer seen by the GC is counted. This means that there could be other referrer objects that point to the referent objects, but they are not included. To display Live Object data, include the -XX:+ProfileLiveObjects option in the JVM command. To view current data, refresh the screen. If a GC has not occurred yet, a message to refresh is displayed.

  "content" : "CPU Tab The CPU tab provides information about how much CPU time is being used by threads. This is measured by recording the length of time it takes a thread to complete a tick, how often a thread accesses sensitive areas of the application code, and the length of time a thread takes to achieve a safepoint. Note Method names in the tick profiler are compiled methods and are no longer being interpreted. All time spent by methods being interpreted is summed as one entry named “Interpreter.” Check the Tick Profile window for functions such as VM_C2 Compiler or Interpreter after launching an application. If these functions are high on the list, then the application is still starting up (a warning message may also appear in the Compiler tab). To determine if the application is warmed up, wait a few seconds, click Reset Tick Profile, then refresh the Web browser until these two threads are not high in the list. The following table describes the Tick Profile window elements. Element Description Pause/Resume the Tick Collection Click Pause The Tick Collection to stop refreshing the list of ticks. This is useful when you need to locate a specific item in a rapidly changing list. Click Resume The Tick Collection and refresh the screen to continue updating the list of ticks. Reset Tick Profile Clears the existing list of ticks and restarts tick collection. Cutoff Filters the list of ticks to list only those values that are greater than or equal to the set cutoff value. Enter value. Click Submit. Below Cutoff At the bottom of the list of ticks, it lists the percentage and number of ticks that are not included in the displayed list as defined by the Cutoff percent value and Threads value. Threads Display the ticks for only the threads listed in this field. Enter value. Click Submit. None, JVM, All The three radio buttons filter the tick data by a tag assigned to it. Whenever a thread is running, it has a current tag assigned to it. That value can change at any time, as the thread does different things. For instance, if you have a thread that is a garbage collection thread, it’s tag might be \"garbage collection\" most of the time, but when that thread was running some specific subtask of GC, it might say GC marking phase. This feature allows collates and displays the data from the aspect of the tag value instead of the method name. The options are: None – don’t filter the list by tags. JVM — group all the JVM compiler ticks into one entry, so that everything is lumped together. Useful if you are trying to get a sense of what overhead the compiler is having. All - only display ticks by tag type for all threads. Instead of showing ticks entries by their method name, group and display them by their tag type. To apply tag filter, click a radio button. Click Submit. Percent The percentage of CPU resources (% of the total number of ticks collected during the collection period) the function used during the time interval. Ticks The number of program counters (“ticks”) collected in the time interval. This includes: Timer ticks – collect for each tick, the thread ID, CPU, stack trace and last eight calling functions when the tick occurs. The time reported, in milliseconds, is thread time, not clock time. Time to safe point ticks – collect the time required to complete a save point process. Source A description of the function being counted. The following are definitions for specific functions: VM_GC Task – the garbage collector for the JVM. ARTA_Performance_Monitor – the function that collects and displays ZVision data. VM_C2 Compiler – the JVM JIT compiler compiling methods indicating that an application is still warming up . generate_monitor enter – the amount of time spent busy-waiting to acquire monitors. Event Profiling Tick Buffer Statistics Statistical information about the total list of ticks. This includes: Ticks within a Buffer – number of ticks a standard tick buffer can hold. There is a fixed maximum of 2K. Available Buffers – number of buffers the user has allocated, as determined by the -XX:EventTickBufferDataBufferMargin=N value, plus the high water mark number of active threads. For example, if you specify 100, and the application has 400 threads simultaneously active, then there are 500 available buffers. This total value is dynamic, but only grows. If suddenly the application drops 300 threads, there continues to be 500 buffers. Theoretical Maximum Ticks (Available Buffer * Ticks/Buffer) – per the listed formula, for example using Ticks within a Buffer maximum (2000) X Available Buffers (500) = 1,000,000. Count of Ticks processed – not all buffers are completely filled at any moment in time. The tick buffers are collecting ticks. Some have not been used yet. This value is the count of all ticks that are in buffers, which is some value less than the theoretical maximum. Profiler Ticks applicable (matched filter criteria) – number of ticks that match the search criteria Other Ticks not applicable (Failed filter criteria) – number of ticks that do not match the search criteria. Profiler Ticks and Other Ticks equal the total number of ticks processed. Meta Ticks Window Meta Ticks measure how long it takes to perform a function. This is not a measure of each thread. Meta Ticks are like timer ticks in nature. They are a discreet packet of information about the state of a thread, but unlike the Profile Ticks, which are created based on some periodic timer, Meta Ticks are created as the thread enters certain specific code paths. The following table describes the Meta Ticks window elements. Element Description Pause/Resume the Tick Collection Click Pause The Tick Collection to stop refreshing the list of ticks. This is useful when you need to locate a specific item in a rapidly changing list. Click Resume The Tick Collection and refresh the screen to continue updating the list of ticks. Reset Tick Profile Clears the existing list of ticks and restarts tick collection. Search Criteria: Single Value Entries Entries Displayed – number of entries displayed on a given page. Tick Start – a search field which determines the earliest tick that is included in the display, based on the elapsed tick counter. Tick End – a search field which determines the latest tick that is included in the display, based on the elapsed tick counter. Search Criteria: Comma Separated Lists These items are all search criteria for metaticks. The five fields in this row can all use comma separated lists as a search criteria. That is, you can search for more than one term simultaneously, by listing those terms with commas separating them. For example, CPU field could contain \"2,5,9\", which would list all metaticks that came from CPU 2, 5 or 9. MetaTick # – value that can be used for searches. The values are preassigned by Azul. User Info # – value assigned dynamically by the application that can be searched on. Tag # – The current Virtual Machine Process Tag of the thread when the metatick occurred. This is a pre-defined value we assign to a thread that can be changed dynamically, to indicate what kind of work the thread is doing. The values are preassigned by Azul. CPU # – the CPU that the thread was executing on when the metatick occurred. Thread # – thread ID for Azul internal use. Data Table List of actual metatick data. See below listed field descriptions. Line item – last 100 meta ticks recorded. Tick Counter – elapsed ticks since startup. Thread ID – thread ID for Azul internal use. CPU – CPU that the thread was executing on when the metatick occurred. MetaTick Type – value for Azul internal use. Value indicates the tag value at the time the tick occurred. MetaTick Type # – string translation of the stored bit value to the metatick type. Tag Name – string human readable translation of the tag number. Tag # – the VM Tag currently assigned when the metatick occurred Stack Frame Address – address of the stack frame at the time the tick occurred. Event Profiling Tick Buffer Statistics The following are diagnostics related to capturing tick statistics. Ticks within a Buffer – number of ticks a standard tick buffer can hold. There is a fixed maximum of 2K. Available Buffers – number of buffers the user has allocated, as determined by the -XX:EventTickBufferDataBufferMargin=N value, plus the high water mark number of active threads.

If suddenly the application drops 300 threads, there continues to be 500 buffers. Theoretical Maximum Ticks (Available Buffer * Ticks/Buf) – per the listed formula, for example using Ticks within a Buffer maximum (2000) X Available Buffers (500) = 1,000,000. Count of Ticks processed – not all buffers are completely filled at any moment in time. The tick buffers are collecting ticks. Some have not been used yet. This value is the count of all ticks that are in buffers, which is some value less than the theoretical maximum. Profiler Ticks applicable (matched filter criteria) – number of ticks that match the search criteria Other Ticks not applicable (Failed filter criteria) – number of ticks that do not match the search criteria. Profiler Ticks and Other Ticks equal the total number of ticks processed. Event Tracker This feature is not supported."

  "content" : "ZVRobot Overview ZVRobot provides a method to collect metrics about the state of a running application and the underlying JVM. It uses the same data collection mechanisms as ZVision but stores each data snapshot persistently to a file. ZVRobot automates collecting and persistently storing the data displayed with a manual ZVision page refresh. The data stored in the files can be viewed through a browser, simulating the ZVision environment. You can set which ZVision pages to collect and, how often and how many times you want to capture the page data. Use the ZVRobot data to help you determine how to tune command line options and optimize your code performance. ZVRobot data includes: Complete internal and environment settings inventory Sample-based method profiling JVM internal subsystem behavior, including GC and the runtime compiler Lock and monitor usage metrics Thread behavior ZVRobot is a simple http client that collects ZVision data from the ARTAPort according to the criteria specified in the ZVRobot.prop file and outputs it to a specified directory as a set of time stamped XML files. It has a very low impact on performance. The ZVRobot client can be started and stopped at any time during a JVM session. ZVRobot requires JVM host connection information: JVM host IP address and JVM host ARTA port The Azul Run Time Analysis (ARTA) port is the application host port specified with the -XX:ARTAPort command line. ZVRobot output is viewable from supported Web browsers with network access to the file system where the ZVRobot files are located. The supported browsers include: Microsoft® Internet Explorer 6 (or later) on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 Mozilla Firefox 1.0.3 (or later) on all supported operating systems Apple Safari™ 2.0 (or later) for macOS"

This ensures that ZVRobot has data from when the incident occurred. In preproduction, use ZVRobot to take samples of the application before implementing major changes or code changes. Compare the ZVRobot data with samples taken with previous application code versions. This helps to identify if code changes have changes the code profile, locking or allocation rates. Periodically (weekly) take a few minutes of samples as a reference point, these reference points can be used to compare peak request loads as well as be used for long term capacity planning with your other tools."

  "content" : "Installing and Configuring ZVRobot Install ZVRobot and modify the ZVRobot properties file to specify the connection to the JVM and select the type of data to collect. Locate the ZVRobot directory within ZVTools.zip. Copy the ZVRobot directory to a host machine where either a Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed. Note For efficient use, move the ZVRobot files to a different machine than the JVM host or Java application you are monitoring. The ZVRobot machine must be networked to the JVM host machine it is monitoring. Locate and open the ZVRobot.prop file. The file is in the top level ZVRobot directory. The file has two sections: Configuration – contains required information you must provide for ZVRobot to communicate with the JVM and options that control collection behavior. See Step 4. Page Types to Collect – contains a list of ZVision pages. Some pages are already configured to be collected. You can turn on or off the collection of any ZVision page. Provide the configuration information. In the top section of the file, enter appropriate values for the following variables: ZVRobotVars.HOST: IP address of the application host where the JVM is running. ZVRobotVars.PORT: Port on the host machine that was specified with the -XX::ARTAPort command line option when the JVM was started. ZVRobotVars.THSIZE: The number of top-level items to request for display in a page. For example, for: IO_OPEN_SOCKETS, this is the number of sockets. THREADS_LIST and THREADS_STACK_TRACE, this is the number of threads to list in a single page. LEAK_SITES, this is the per page number of location in the code identified as sites where memory is being leaked. ZVRobotVars.SECONDS: The interval in seconds between sequential requests by ZVRobot to the JVM. ZVRobotVars.COUNT: The number of snapshots to gather. A negative number is interpreted as a request for an infinite number of snapshots. If you use this option, stop the ZVRobot process with CTRL-C from the command line. Select the metrics to collect. In the third section of the file, remove or add the pound (#) character to enable or disable, respectively, collecting a page’s data. For example: To enable a <metric_name> metric, the line in the file should be:  <metric_name>=http://${HOST}:${PORT} ${SECONDS} ${COUNT} To disable the <metric_name> metric, comment out the line by adding the pound sign (#) in the line. The line in the file should be:  # <metric_name>=http://${HOST}:${PORT} ${SECONDS} ${COUNT}"

Threads List Window The Threads List window displays all threads, status of each thread, and links to detailed information about a thread. Click a hyperlink in the left column to display the collected information for a snapshot. The number of snapshots and the interval between snapshot collection is specified by the ZVRobotVars.COUNT and ZVRobotVars.SECOND variables in the ZVRobot.prop file. The following table describes the Threads List window elements. Element Description Name Lists the name of the thread as assigned by the application. State The most common states for threads are: running: the thread is executing on a processor core. I/O wait: the thread is waiting for socket or file I/O. acquiring monitor: the thread is waiting to acquire a synchronization monitor. acquiring and releasing monitor: the thread a requires and releases a synchronization monitor. This typically happens when the critical section of the monitor is extremely small. sleeping: the thread executed java.lang.Thread.sleep(). Other states, such as idle, semaphore wait, waiting on JVM monitor Threads lock, or Waiting on Monitor SLT lock indicate threads that are internal to the JVM. These states are not normally useful for analysis of application performance. Also, during start up, compiler threads might be running. The time (in seconds) that the thread has spent since entering the state is provided in parenthesis after the waiting state indicators. Details Provides links to a stack trace, tick profile, and object profile for the selected thread. These functions are the same as the regular tick and profile features, except that only information on the selected thread displays. The following links appear inline with threads listed in this window: *Stack: displays a thread execution details window. *Ticks: displays a per-thread profile. *Allocations: displays a thread-level Object profile. This window displays real-time counters for allocated bytes, allocated count, and average object size per object type allocated by the thread since the most recent GC cycle start. Stack Trace Window The Stack Trace window lists all threads and displays whether a thread is executing or is blocked. This can help to determine changes to make in the application code.

The number of snapshots and the interval between snapshot collection is specified by the ZVRobotVars.COUNT and ZVRobotVars.SECOND variables in the ZVRobot.prop file. The following table describes the Threads List window elements. Element Description Name Lists the name of the thread as assigned by the application. State The most common states for threads are: running: the thread is executing on a processor core. I/O wait: the thread is waiting for socket or file I/O. acquiring monitor: the thread is waiting to acquire a synchronization monitor. acquiring and releasing monitor: the thread a requires and releases a synchronization monitor. This typically happens when the critical section of the monitor is extremely small. sleeping: the thread executed java.lang.Thread.sleep(). Other states, such as idle, semaphore wait, waiting on JVM monitor Threads lock, or Waiting on Monitor SLT lock indicate threads that are internal to the JVM. These states are not normally useful for analysis of application performance. Also, during start up, compiler threads might be running. The time (in seconds) that the thread has spent since entering the state is provided in parenthesis after the waiting state indicators. Details Provides links to a stack trace, tick profile, and object profile for the selected thread. These functions are the same as the regular tick and profile features, except that only information on the selected thread displays. The following links appear inline with threads listed in this window: *Stack: displays a thread execution details window. *Ticks: displays a per-thread profile. *Allocations: displays a thread-level Object profile. This window displays real-time counters for allocated bytes, allocated count, and average object size per object type allocated by the thread since the most recent GC cycle start."

  "content" : "Although the Java platform simplifies many aspects of software development, it introduces side effects of its runtime environment and memory models that can negatively affect runtime performance. Some performance concerns include the following: System pauses during garbage collection (GC) Warmup delays for just-in-time compilation Response latencies Once you have identified performance problems, you can perform root-cause analysis to determine the exact cause of the problem. You can perform root-cause analysis with unit and system tests but another option is to analyze the GC log. This article describes the following: How to create a GC log How to view the log data in the GC Log Analyzer tool How to interpret log analyzer metrics and visual graphs to resolve common Java performance problems. It’s important to note that the GC Log Analyzer can help identify a wide range of problems, from common to uncommon and from severe to trivial, which means choosing which graphs to look at in order to identify particular problems is purely a subjective task which changes from person to person. The information covered in this guide is meant to give you only a general idea of how to identify the most common and severe problems, using real-world examples."

Although the log generator supports many options, the above is enough to get started. You can learn more about GC log output options from the Unified Logging documentation. Run your application under the same stress as your live application if possible. If not, you may have to simulate typical application conditions so that you duplicate the problematic behavior. Once you have a sufficient amount of log data, you are ready to view the logs with the GC Log Analyzer."

  "content" : "Looking at the Graphs The GC Log Analyzer contains a lot of data and can seem overwhelming. It’s important to familiarize yourself with which graphs can indicate which problems. The following graphs were chosen for this example as they are commonly used to identify particular common problems. The graphs in the following sections displaying problematic behavior were obtained using an application simulator. All of the following graphs are from the same system using the same bad system setup. The initial bad setup has the following problems: Heaps are too small - 8GB Elastic heap set to true Large amount of reference data loaded - 5GB No garbage collection after reference data is loaded Too short rampup Too high transaction rates - 4 threads with 200 transactions/second each GC > GC Time (Percent) Click GC > GC Time (Percent) to see the percent of time that the garbage collector threads are running along the Y axis, over time along the X axis. The following graph shows collector threads running 100% of the time very frequently. Any spike above 30% should be investigated. This is a clear indication of a problem. Because the GC is running frequently and for long amounts of time, the application may be suffering from a lack of heap memory size. The next graph shows a healthy GC Time graph: GC > GC Count Click GC > GC Count to see the accumulated count of GC cycles over the lifetime of the application. In the following graph, focus on the \"New GC Count\" line (blue). Look for periods where the new GC count rises quickly. Calculate the number of cycles per minute. Take two points on the graph, and calculate the time differential and the GC count differential. We want to calculate cycles per minute. You should investigate anything over 10 cycles/minute. Anything over 20 cycles/minute is a serious concern. In the above graph, let’s look at the 1-minute interval from 30 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds. If you hover the mouse over the graph, the analyzer will show you the exact time and GC count. Using the above graph, we do the following calculation:  72 cycles - 17 cycles = 55 cycles\n72 cycles/1 min = 55 cycles/min The graph above shows that the GC is running 55 times a minute. This is a serious cause for concern. The following graph shows a healthy GC count graph. When we use the same method to calculate GC cycles, using a 10 minute interval, we can see that the GC is running just 0.2 times a minute.  422 cycles – 420 cycles = 2 cycles\n2 cycles/10 min = 0.2 cycles/min Java Heap > Garbage Collected click Java Heap > Garbage Collected to see the amount of memory reclaimed by the garbage collector for both \"newGen\" and \"oldGen\" memory. The more garbage collected per cycle, the better. Watch for dramatic drops in the amount of garbage collected per collection cycle. This is particularly troublesome if you also notice cycle frequency increases, too. Typically, a healthy graph will show newGen cycles reclaim at least 10x than oldGen cycles. The following graph shows an unhealthy Java Heap graph. You can compare the above graph to the below graph, showing a healthy Java Heap graph. System > Load Average Click System > Load Average to display the thread count over time as the application runs. One sign of memory pressure is a thread count spike that is greater than the number of cores. For example, the following graph, from a machine with 8 cores and 16 threads, shows frequent jumps above 20 system threads, all the way up to 60 system threads, which suggests low memory. The following graph, from the same machine with 8 cores and 16 threads, shows a healthy Load Average graph, showing a steady average load under 5 threads. Java Heap > Live Set Click Java Heap > Live Set (either Known Live or Not Known as Dead) to show how big the objects were during garbage collection cycles. This set of graphs is only an estimate of object size. The \"Known Live\" graph represents an underestimate while the \"Not Known as Dead\" graph represents an overestimate. Old heap garbage collection is more stable than new heap garbage collection. You know from the system configuration that reference data is being loaded at the beginning. With this in mind, the following unhealthy graph shows that too much reference data is being loaded at system startup, causing system instability. Furthermore, you can see that old heap garbage collection stops entirely after just 28 seconds. The following healthy graph shows the same initial loading of reference data, yet old heap garbage collection continues to an eventually stable state."

  "content" : "Conclusions The GC Log Analyzer is an important tool for understanding application and JVM performance. Although the tool has much more functionality, you can gain significant awareness of your application performance by investigating just a few major graphs and metrics. Here is a brief review of the graphs covered in this guide and why they are important: GC > GC Time (percent) - Even if all else is perfect, irregularities and too high of a value may hint towards a scalability limitation. GC > GC Count - A high number of garbage collection cycles indicates a serious problem. Java Heap > Garbage Collected - Should be nice and regular newGen and fairly infrequent oldGen. System > Load Average - Check if your CPU is being overloaded. Java Heap > Live Set - Too big of a live set with too little room to spare. In the examples shown in this article, GC cycle times were frequent and often ran at 100% capacity. This is indicative of significant memory pressure. Although system memory is significantly higher than application memory, we might suspect that the heap size is too small. One of the resolutions includes increasing heap size.

  "content" : "An Introduction to JIT Compilation When people think of Java compilers, they usually think about javac, which turns your Java source code into Java bytecode. But equally important is JIT compilation, which turns your Java bytecode into optimized machine code for the specific hardware on which your Java program is running. When you first start your Java program, the JVM takes the platform-independent bytecode and runs it in the interpreter, which takes more CPU resources and is slower to execute. After a certain number of invocations (default 1K), the method is promoted to a profiling tier, known as the Tier 1 compiler or C1. Here the JVM monitors the method to build a profile of how many times each method is called, with which code paths, and how they are executed in the profiled method. After the compile threshold is reached (default 10K), the JVM promotes the method to the Tier 2 compiler by putting it in the Tier 2 compile queue. The Tier 2 compiler uses the Tier 1 profile to compile methods into highly optimized machine code. Speed of the application through the different phases of interpreted bytecode, Tier 1 profiling, and Tier 2 optimized code Because JIT compilation needs to use the same resources that your program runs, JIT compilers are usually very conservative in their operations. The performance of your application is lower and less stable during the warm-up phase when the JVM is identifying and compiling all hot methods. Eventually, compilation activity settles down and your code achieves its optimum stable performance. Note JIT optimization is often only one part of what is commonly seen as \"warm-up\". Other parts of warm-up include initializing resources needed by the application, rehydrating data from caches, etc. If you are experiencing long warm-up times, make sure to analyze everything that is happening during warm-up. JIT compilers make speculations on the best way to optimize methods based on the usage seen in the life of the program so far. Sometimes those speculations turn out to be incorrect. When this happens, the JVM performs a de-optimization, or deopt, in which the compiled method is discarded and the method is run in the interpreter or in Tier 1 until the JIT compiler can provide a newly compiled method that matches the new usage patterns."

  "content" : "Azul Zulu Prime JDK and the Falcon JIT Compiler Azul Zulu Prime JDK replaces OpenJDK’s HotSpot JIT compiler with Azul’s Falcon JIT compiler. Unlike HotSpot, Falcon has different levels of optimizations that you can use to balance eventual code speed versus how much time and computer resources you can commit to JIT warmup. Wherever you have enough CPU capacity and time to warm up using full Falcon optimizations running locally on your JVM, you should do so. Full Falcon optimizations deliver the best performance and infrastructure savings. There are many reasons to be sensitive to long warm-up, even if it delivers higher eventual speed: Long warm-up times make CI/CD rolling upgrades of a fleet of VMs is too long. Your SLAs mean you can’t start accepting traffic on a newly started node until it can serve requests at a certain speed. You have policies in place that throttle traffic or spin up new instances when CPU utilization goes over a certain percentage. You have to reserve capacity on your machines for the spike in CPU activity during warm-up, even though you do not need those resources for the regular running of your application. There are several ways you can affect the warm-up of Azul Zulu Prime JDK: Tune the Delivery of Full Falcon Optimizations Using Lower Optimization Levels Use Cloud Native Compiler Use ReadyNow Warm-Up Optimizer On this page, we explore many options to tune the JIT compiler to suit our needs. For ease of use, you can use the option VMFootprintLevel to set many of the parameters described here with one easy-to-use option."

  "content" : "Tuning JIT Compilations Setting the JVM Footprint For ease of use, Azul has introduced a parameter, VMFootprintLevel, which tunes various parts of the JVM to run on different configurations with different constraints by modifying a number of options. Since VMFootprintLevel tunes a number of internal options, it can be described as a \"master\" option. Further, when you manually set any option, that option is overridden by the same option set by VMFootprintLevel. In this way, you can use VMFootprintLevel as a starting point, with further tweaks to the JIT compiler done as needed. You can set VMFootprintLevel to \"XL\", \"L\", \"M\" or \"S\". \"XL\" is the default and specifying \"XL\" will cause no difference in behaviour. For the full list of parameters which are modified by VMFootprintLevel, see JVMFootprint Parameters at the end of this page. But first, let’s look at the various ways the JIT compiler can be modified. Tune the Delivery of Full Falcon Optimizations The Falcon compiler can be tuned in several ways: Give Falcon more threads. The normal heuristic is for Falcon to be allocated 2/3 of the total threads, but on a small machine, it can get rounded down to 1. You give Falcon a specific number of threads using the following flag: -XX:CIMaxCompilerThreads=3 (= 3 threads in this example). Note -XX:CIMaxCompilerThreads=3 will increase both Tier 1 (C1) and Tier 2 (C2) compiler threads. In case you want to distinguish between Tier 1 and Tier 2, the flags -XX:C1MaxCompilerThreads=3 and -XX:C2MaxCompilerThreads=3 can be used. Lower the Falcon compile threshold. The default threshold is 10K, which means a method must be invoked 10K times before it is put in the compilation queue. Lowering this number improves the warm-up curve but means there will be more compilation activity as more methods would be compiled when reaching 5K invocations instead of the 10K invocations required with the default value. Set the compile threshold using -XX:FalconCompileThreshold=5000. Note With Azul Zulu Prime JDK, -XX:FalconCompileThreshold=5000 behaves the same way as -XX:C2CompileThreshold=5000, as Falcon is the Tier 2 compiler, or C2, in Azul Prime. Lower the C1 compile threshold using XX:C1CompileThreshold=100. C1, or client compiler, generally uses less memory and compiles methods quicker than C2 but not at a cost. Since C2 compiled code is better optimized, it is often worthwhile to use C2 compiled code rather than C1 compiled code, but only where total startup time is not a concern. If startup time is a concern and the goal is to get a better warmup time, it is better to run through methods using C1 compilation. This is easily achieved by lowering the C1 compile threshold. In Azul Prime, C1CompileThreshold is set to 1000 by default. Give extra resources to the compiler for a set amount of time. Normally, the Compiler must share resources with executed code. Using -XX:CompilerWarmupPeriodSeconds, setting a timeframe to exclusively run the compiler during warmup, together with -XX:CompilerWarmupExtraThreads, allocating an extra number of threads to the compiler during warmup, will tell the JVM to give all available resources to the compiler for a set amount of time. After which, resources can finally be used by the application. This can greatly speed up warmup time but also restricts the use of the application during warmup. Using Lower Optimization Levels If you have tweaked the above settings and your warm-up time is still too long, you can lower optimization levels from Full Falcon down to the KestrelC2 compiler (light-weight Falcon). Each optimization level will give lower compile time and lower code speed. Each lower optimization level yields a drop in speed of C2 compilation from the next higher optimization level, in most cases, but also reduces the total compile time. Available levels of optimization are described below: Falcon Optimization Level 2 - Full Falcon: the full set of super-optimizations that deliver on average 20-30% faster code than OpenJDK’s HotSpot compiler. This is the recommended approach and the default configuration. Falcon Optimization Level 1 - code runs about 5% slower than Opt level 2 and reduces the compile time by about 50%. Enabled using the following option: -XX:FalconOptimizationLevel=1 Falcon Optimization Level 0 - code runs about 30% slower than Opt level 2 and reduces the compile time by about 70%. Opt level 0 is roughly comparable to Zulu C2 performance. Enabled using the following option: -XX:FalconOptimizationLevel=0 KestrelC2: a limited set of optimizations designed to approximate the warm-up costs and eventual code speed of OpenJDK’s HotSpot compiler. Code compiled with KestrelC2 will have a lower eventual speed than code compiled with full Falcon optimizations, but will reach an optimal state faster and with fewer resources. Enabled using the following option: -XX:+UseKestrelC2 Different compiler options can be used to lower the optimization levels and affect the amount of time and resources that Falcon uses to optimize your code. For more info on this topic, see Command Line Options > Falcon Compiler Options. A solution for the slower optimized code in these circumstances is provided by Azul’s Cloud Native Compiler. Setting Falcon to Prioritize Method Compilation Based on Hotness As your compile queue builds up with methods reaching the compile threshold, it can contain many methods that were once hot but are no longer, and therefore are not as critical to compile now. An example is an application platform that first performs many initialization operations and then has a different set of methods that are called once the application is initialized. Falcon offers two different ways to prioritize method compilation based on hotness. Avoid compiling cold methods. This is accomplished by not compiling methods which do not reach the compile threshold within a specified amount of time, reducing the overall amount of work that the compiler must do. This is done using the flag -XX:TopTierCompileThresholdTriggerMillis. This flag simply tells the compiler to check whether a method has reached the compile threshold within the specified amount of time. The time period is counted from a method’s first execution to the moment it reaches the compile threshold. If a method has reached the compile threshold, but not within the time period specified, the method is considered cold and is not compiled. Utilize compilation ranking. Beyond just hot and cold, compilation ranking introduces \"warm\" methods, as well. Via compilation ranking, Falcon is able to assign a rank to each method, either hot, warm, or cold, based on the amount of time it takes a method to reach the compile threshold. Hot methods are given priority of resources for compilation over warm methods, warm methods are still compiled at some point, and cold methods are excluded from compilation. Compilation ranking does not reduce the overall work that Falcon must do compared to TopTierCompileThresholdTriggerMillis, but rather spreads out Falcon’s work over a longer period of time. Compilation ranking is set up using the following flags: -XX:TopTierHotCompileThresholdTriggerMillis - Sets the upper bound for the hot rank and lower bound for the warm rank. Default value is 60000. -XX:TopTierWarmCompileThresholdTriggerMillis - Sets the upper bound for the warm rank and lower bound for the cold rank. Default value is 600000. -XX:TopTierWarmCompileCpuPercent - CPU thread allocation for warm methods. Default is 25%. For example, setting the hot compile threshold trigger to 5000, the warm compile threshold trigger to 50000, and the warm compile cpu percent to 50, results in the following ranks: Hot - Reach the compile threshold in 4999 ms or less, 100% CPU budget. Warm - Reach the compile threshold in 5000-49999 ms, 50% CPU budget. Cold - Reach the compile threshold in 50000 ms or more, 0% CPU budget. Note TopTierCompileThresholdTriggerMillis can not be used together with compilation ranking options."

You give Falcon a specific number of threads using the following flag: -XX:CIMaxCompilerThreads=3 (= 3 threads in this example). Note -XX:CIMaxCompilerThreads=3 will increase both Tier 1 (C1) and Tier 2 (C2) compiler threads. In case you want to distinguish between Tier 1 and Tier 2, the flags -XX:C1MaxCompilerThreads=3 and -XX:C2MaxCompilerThreads=3 can be used. Lower the Falcon compile threshold. The default threshold is 10K, which means a method must be invoked 10K times before it is put in the compilation queue. Lowering this number improves the warm-up curve but means there will be more compilation activity as more methods would be compiled when reaching 5K invocations instead of the 10K invocations required with the default value. Set the compile threshold using -XX:FalconCompileThreshold=5000. Note With Azul Zulu Prime JDK, -XX:FalconCompileThreshold=5000 behaves the same way as -XX:C2CompileThreshold=5000, as Falcon is the Tier 2 compiler, or C2, in Azul Prime. Lower the C1 compile threshold using XX:C1CompileThreshold=100. C1, or client compiler, generally uses less memory and compiles methods quicker than C2 but not at a cost. Since C2 compiled code is better optimized, it is often worthwhile to use C2 compiled code rather than C1 compiled code, but only where total startup time is not a concern. If startup time is a concern and the goal is to get a better warmup time, it is better to run through methods using C1 compilation. This is easily achieved by lowering the C1 compile threshold. In Azul Prime, C1CompileThreshold is set to 1000 by default. Give extra resources to the compiler for a set amount of time. Normally, the Compiler must share resources with executed code. Using -XX:CompilerWarmupPeriodSeconds, setting a timeframe to exclusively run the compiler during warmup, together with -XX:CompilerWarmupExtraThreads, allocating an extra number of threads to the compiler during warmup, will tell the JVM to give all available resources to the compiler for a set amount of time. After which, resources can finally be used by the application. This can greatly speed up warmup time but also restricts the use of the application during warmup."

  "content" : "Using Lower Optimization Levels If you have tweaked the above settings and your warm-up time is still too long, you can lower optimization levels from Full Falcon down to the KestrelC2 compiler (light-weight Falcon). Each optimization level will give lower compile time and lower code speed. Each lower optimization level yields a drop in speed of C2 compilation from the next higher optimization level, in most cases, but also reduces the total compile time. Available levels of optimization are described below: Falcon Optimization Level 2 - Full Falcon: the full set of super-optimizations that deliver on average 20-30% faster code than OpenJDK’s HotSpot compiler. This is the recommended approach and the default configuration. Falcon Optimization Level 1 - code runs about 5% slower than Opt level 2 and reduces the compile time by about 50%. Enabled using the following option: -XX:FalconOptimizationLevel=1 Falcon Optimization Level 0 - code runs about 30% slower than Opt level 2 and reduces the compile time by about 70%. Opt level 0 is roughly comparable to Zulu C2 performance. Enabled using the following option: -XX:FalconOptimizationLevel=0 KestrelC2: a limited set of optimizations designed to approximate the warm-up costs and eventual code speed of OpenJDK’s HotSpot compiler. Code compiled with KestrelC2 will have a lower eventual speed than code compiled with full Falcon optimizations, but will reach an optimal state faster and with fewer resources. Enabled using the following option: -XX:+UseKestrelC2 Different compiler options can be used to lower the optimization levels and affect the amount of time and resources that Falcon uses to optimize your code. For more info on this topic, see Command Line Options > Falcon Compiler Options. A solution for the slower optimized code in these circumstances is provided by Azul’s Cloud Native Compiler."

  "link" : "https://docs.azul.com/prime/analyzing-tuning-warmup#_setting_falcon_priorities",
  "content" : "Setting Falcon to Prioritize Method Compilation Based on Hotness As your compile queue builds up with methods reaching the compile threshold, it can contain many methods that were once hot but are no longer, and therefore are not as critical to compile now. An example is an application platform that first performs many initialization operations and then has a different set of methods that are called once the application is initialized. Falcon offers two different ways to prioritize method compilation based on hotness. Avoid compiling cold methods. This is accomplished by not compiling methods which do not reach the compile threshold within a specified amount of time, reducing the overall amount of work that the compiler must do. This is done using the flag -XX:TopTierCompileThresholdTriggerMillis. This flag simply tells the compiler to check whether a method has reached the compile threshold within the specified amount of time. The time period is counted from a method’s first execution to the moment it reaches the compile threshold. If a method has reached the compile threshold, but not within the time period specified, the method is considered cold and is not compiled. Utilize compilation ranking. Beyond just hot and cold, compilation ranking introduces \"warm\" methods, as well. Via compilation ranking, Falcon is able to assign a rank to each method, either hot, warm, or cold, based on the amount of time it takes a method to reach the compile threshold. Hot methods are given priority of resources for compilation over warm methods, warm methods are still compiled at some point, and cold methods are excluded from compilation. Compilation ranking does not reduce the overall work that Falcon must do compared to TopTierCompileThresholdTriggerMillis, but rather spreads out Falcon’s work over a longer period of time. Compilation ranking is set up using the following flags: -XX:TopTierHotCompileThresholdTriggerMillis - Sets the upper bound for the hot rank and lower bound for the warm rank. Default value is 60000. -XX:TopTierWarmCompileThresholdTriggerMillis - Sets the upper bound for the warm rank and lower bound for the cold rank. Default value is 600000. -XX:TopTierWarmCompileCpuPercent - CPU thread allocation for warm methods. Default is 25%. For example, setting the hot compile threshold trigger to 5000, the warm compile threshold trigger to 50000, and the warm compile cpu percent to 50, results in the following ranks: Hot - Reach the compile threshold in 4999 ms or less, 100% CPU budget. Warm - Reach the compile threshold in 5000-49999 ms, 50% CPU budget. Cold - Reach the compile threshold in 50000 ms or more, 0% CPU budget. Note TopTierCompileThresholdTriggerMillis can not be used together with compilation ranking options."

  "content" : "Analyzing Java Warm-up So how do you know if your application is warmed up? The best way is by measuring the performance of your program by whatever metric you would normally measure it with. This could be operations/second or service time. Run a very long test and see how long it takes to reach 99% of peak performance and remain steadily at that level for a long period of time. Note that JIT compilers often keep performing optimizations long after you’ve reached your optimal peak performance. Therefore, you see higher CPU activity even after your code is running at optimal peak performance. When analyzing the compiler behavior, Azul Platform Prime’s Garbage Collector (GC) log file is the first information source to look into because this log file not only tracks GC information. On Azul Platform Prime, the log also contains much information about compilation activity and general system resources utilization. Add this flag to the Java command line to enable GC logging: -Xlog:gc,safepoint:gc.log::filecount=0. The filecount=0 setting disables log file rotation, resulting in one single log file which simplifies the tuning workflow. For further details about GC logging see Unified Garbage Collection Logging Recommendations and Advanced tuning hints. After your test, open the log file in the Azul GC Log Analyzer (download). With this tool you can check the following information: Number of threads/cores available for JIT compilation Total number of threads/cores and RAM for the process Compiler Queues: shows the number of methods waiting for compilation over time. Large numbers of methods in the compiler queues mean that Falcon does not have enough resources to handle all incoming requests Compiler Threads: shows how many threads were used over time for the JIT compilation Tier 2 Compile Counts and Tier 2 Wait Time Distribution: shows the full amount of compilations requested over the life of the process and how long it took to fulfill requests."

This test application is run on a small machine to see the impact of threads on warm-up. First, no parameters were used. In a second run of the same test, startup parameters were added: -XX:CIMaxCompilerThreads=3 to use more threads, and -XX:FalconCompileThreshold=5000 for a lower compiler threshold instead of the default 10K. System Information Let’s look at an example GC log. Open the log by running java -jar GCLogAnalyzer2.jar gc.log. Click the button to see the overall information about the process: System information of an application without additional flags You can see that the process is running on 6 threads overall. Scrolling down to the bottom, you see the following for the test without additional parameters: So there is only one thread for JIT compilation, which is generally not recommended for on-JVM JIT compilation on Azul Zulu Prime JDK.

With the same additional flags for extra threads and lower compiler threshold, there is a more reasonable use of the three compiler threads over time rather than one thread being constantly maxed out. Compiler threads without parameters, versus extra threads and lower compile threshold. Compile Counts Clicking \"Compiler Statistics\" > \"Tier 2 Compile Counts\" shows a large number of the methods being evicted from the queue before they can be compiled. In the second run, the Compile Counts shows a much smaller number of methods getting evicted from the queue. Compile counts without parameters, versus extra threads and lower compile threshold.

For example, your program could have an initialization phase followed by a steady run phase. The methods that are the hottest in the initialization phase may not be the same methods that are needed when you move to your steady run phase. Azul Zulu Prime JDK optimizes for this situation by continuing to count invocations after the compilation threshold has been reached. Every time there are another 10K invocations, the JVM increments a counter on the method. If the counter hasn’t been incremented in 20s, meaning it hasn’t been called 10K times in the last 20 seconds, the method is evicted from the compile queue.

As all Azul Zulu Prime JVM modes use the same C4 GC algorithm, good performance regarding the garbage collection is expected and for most applications, the default setting is sufficient. However, some applications may benefit from the use of large pages (2 MB) due to reduced misses on the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). Azul Zulu Prime JVM with ZST implements a more efficient memory manager for large pages than standard Linux and is recommended in those situations.

  "content" : "Setting tuning options can be complicated, so RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) has an installable daemon, tuned, that provides some tuning options, defined as profiles, to improve performance. This tuned periodically collects data about hardware subsystems, such as disks, network I/O, and switches. Then, based on the option selected, tuned dynamically adjusts system settings to raise or lower power consumption modes for these devices on your system. Note For Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM), lower power consumption modes are detrimental to performance because if a core goes to sleep and the Garbage Collector or application has a thread that needs to run, then the cost of 'warming' up the core is expensive in time as the cache gets loaded and the pipeline is filled, etc. Two tuned profiles that might be useful with your Azul Zulu Prime JVM installation: throughput-performance This is a server profile for typical throughput performance tuning. It disables tuned and ktune power saving mechanisms, enables sysctl settings that improve the throughput performance of your disk and network I/O, and switches to the deadline scheduler. latency-performance This is a server profile for typical low-latency performance tuning that can reduce RHEL jitter caused by the OS. It disables tuned and ktune power saving mechanisms and enables sysctl settings that improve the latency performance of your network I/O. The latency-performance profile on RHEL can improve the max response time, depending upon the application running on Azul Zulu Prime JVM, by several (maybe 10s) of msec compared to to the tuned default profile. You can set and un-set these profiles with tuned-adm. The profiles are implemented with the tuned daemon."

False sharing is a term to describe performance degradation when several threads are modifying independent variable(s) sharing the same cache line. @Contended is applied as a conventional Java language annotation to fields in a class. It specifies that some field(s) in an object are probably highly contended across processor cores. At runtime the VM optimizes field layout. At the VM’s discretion, those fields annotated as contended are given extra padding so they do not share cache lines with other fields that are likely to be independently accessed. This helps to avoid cache contention across multiple threads. Note Applying @Contended to a class, field, or group: Does not force the VM to add padding or optimize the field layout in a specific way. Can substantially increase the size of a given object. Because the increase in size can be double or more, use @Contended sparingly. Zing provides an implementation of this feature for JDK 7."

It reports information about threads that are slow to reach safepoint. This is referred to as Time To Safepoint (TTSP). All JVM’s use safepoints to bring all of the application threads to a known state so the JVM can perform certain operations. Safepoints are used during Garbage Collection, during JIT compilation, for Thread Dumps, and many other operations. When a safepoint call is issued all of the application threads should \"come to safepoint\" as fast as possible. Threads that have come to safepoint block until the JVM releases them. Once all of the threads are at safepoint, the JVM performs the operation — GC, compile, thread dump, etc. — and then releases all the threads to run again. But when one or more application threads take a long time to come to safepoint, all of the other threads, which are now blocked, have to wait for the tardy thread(s). Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s Safepoint Profiler will identify those tardy threads and help you to figure out why they are slow to reach safepoint."

  "content" : "Safepoint Profiler Overview Safepoint Profiler is an in-process profiling tool that collects stacks of the threads that were late to safepoint at frequent intervals asynchronously and also collects other system related information like the number of cores assigned to the thread. These logs can be collected and analyzed later to find the reason for the high TTSP issue. Safepoint Profiler is designed to have the minimal possible impact on the Azul Zulu Prime JVM performance. The tool uses Linux signals to collect asynchronous stack traces of “slow” threads. The waiting VMThread sends RealTime signals (the “TTSP signal”) to slow Java threads after exceeding the profiling threshold (tunable by flags). System level attributes are also recorded for the slow threads (wchan, thread state, etc). These attributes are stored in private buffers assigned to slow Java threads. When a slow JavaThread receives the TTSP signal, it records its stacks into its buffer. At the end of safepoint, the VMThread walks all the Java threads in the process and prints out the buffers of the corresponding thread if available. To make TTSP overhead as lightweight as possible, there is no need to wait until slow Java threads respond to the signal that was sent by the VMThread. Since the Linux kernel sometimes delays delivering signals to a thread, it is entirely possible for a slow JavaThread to receive the signal after the whole safepoint is complete. An additional stack recording mechanism called \"synchronous stack\" serves as an extra stack that indicates the path from where the JavaThread gave up the jvm_lock (while reaching Safepoint). This way ensures there is at least one stack even if the signal delivery mechanism was not fast enough and didn’t record any asynchronous stack. Synchronous stack can be identified among the other stacks of a thread by looking at the top two frames in the StackTrace. It would indicate the path through which a JavaThread gave up the jvm_lock.  #0 0x00000000209f41d5 SafepointProfilerBuf::record_sync_stack(JavaThread*)\n#1 0x0000000020a35d68 JavaThread::safepoint_profiler_record_sync_stack()\n#2 0x000000002067a1c6 JavaThread::jvm_unlock_self()\n#3 0x00000000206bdd62 JavaThread::poll_at_safepoint()\n#4 0x0000000020a36fab JavaThread::poll_at_safepoint_static(JavaThread*)\n#5 0x00000000300068ba StubRoutines::safepoint_handler\n#6 0x000000003000b43a ContendedClass.run()V\n#7 0x00000000319a65ca interpreter\n#8 0x0000000030003035 StubRoutines::call_stub"

So, for the current default value of SafepointTimoutDelay 50000, we would start profiling the threads once we cross 1000 ms (2% of timeout). The default value of this flag is 2. -XX:SafepointProfilerInterval This is the interval in percentage of safepoint/ checkpoint that controls the frequency at which you would like to collect multiple stack samples for a TTSP issue. The default value is 10 and minimum value is 5%. -XX:SafepointProfilerThresholdMS Specifies the number of milliseconds, which the VMThread waits before sending the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth backtrace request for each laggard thread. Using this flag replaces the use of SafepointProfilerThreshold, which applies to both checkpoints and safepoints. After the fifth backtrace without reaching [safe/check] point, subsequent wait intervals are computed by using the SafepointProfilerInterval value."

Field Description Detected TTSP issue: start: 31.259 wait: 17.526 This is the header that indicates the start of the logging for specific TTSP issue: * start – The VM uptime, this time is used to match against the GC log file to find the corresponding SPS. * wait – The actual wait time in milliseconds as seen in the SPS line. Dumping stack for thread 0x0000440005e00000 This is the header for each thread that had TTSP and whose stack will be logged. \"Thread-1\" id: 30703 prio: 5 os_prio: 0 sched: SCHED_OTHER allowed_cpus: 000000000ffffff Thread-1 – The thread name. id – LWP of the thread. prio – Java level priority os_prio – OS level priority sched – Scheduler chosen for the thread. allowed_cpus – The number of the CPUs that the thread is allowed to run. Each bit represents a CPU. lock_release: 31.276 This line is printed only for the synchronously collected stack. The time here means the time this JavaThread actually gave up the lock. But this does not mean that all the threads are at safepoint at this point in time, since there could be other threads that would have taken longer to reach. signal_sent: 31.271 signal_responded: 31.276 Applicable to only asynchronously collected stacks. signal sent – The time when VMThread issued a signal to this thread to record its stack. signal responded – The time at which the thread actually responded (received) the signal to dump the stack. If there is a huge difference in the time stamps of these fields, this could possibly indicate the following two among other unknown possibilities: The thread was not scheduled hence the kernel couldn’t deliver the signal immediately. This could possibly hint at starvation issues. The thread was in uninterrupted mode, so the signal was in the pending signal list. Examples: Page fault handler. state: R wchan: 0 This line is applicable only for asynchronously collected stacks: state – State of the thread when the signal was sent from the VMThread. wchan – Waiting channel state if the thread was waiting for something. last_cpu: 20 cpu_time: 17563 last cpu – The last CPU the thread was known to be running on. cpu time – Prints the clock CPU time of the thread."

  "content" : "ZVision and ZVRobot Note As of Azul Platform Prime 23.08.0.0, ZVision and ZVRobot components have been deprecated and are no longer supported. The information in this section is only informative and is planned for removal. ZVision and ZVRobot work with Azul Zulu Prime JVM to expose the lower level details about the runtime – both the JVM’s and the application’s. The questions to be answered: What methods and functions are executing? How much CPU time is consumed executing those methods? What is the call chain to the methods consuming most of the CPU time? The first step is to add the command line options to the command line for the ZVM:  -XX:ARTAPort=<port-number> -XX:+UseTickProfiler You can connect directly with the ZVM using the ZVision server (run the $JAVA_HOME/bin/zvision program and then connect with your browser to the machine and port for ZVision). Alternatively, you can use ZVRobot to collect the same information. To set up ZVRobot, extract the contents of the etc/ZVRobot.zip file to a directory: ZVRobot.prop – the property file that instructs ZVRobot to collect metrics. ZVRobot-<version>.jar – the ZVRobot archive. README– overall instructions on how to run ZVRobot. startsample.sh – simplified script for running ZVRobot. Each of the files, README, ZVRobot.prop, and startsample.sh contain instructions on how to modify files and run ZVRobot. Modify the ZVRobot.prop file for your environment. First, the host and ARTAPort for the ZVM you want to monitor. Set the following properties:  ZVRobotVars.HOST=YouMustSet_TheZingVM_Host_IPAddress_In_ZVRobot.prop\nZVRobotVars.PORT=YouMustSet_TheZingVM_Host_PortNumber_In_ZVRobot.prop To start, use the default values for the following: ZVRobotVars.THSIZE=10000 – Number of data sample sizes to collect; mostly for the thread stacks number of threads. ZVRobotVars.SECONDS=60 – Seconds between samples. ZVRobotVars.COUNT=-1 – Continue collecting until the ZVRobot process is killed. The following captures additional information for the top FETCHCOUNT entries in the tick profile page. The additional information for each is the machine instruction page that contains the instructions generated by the compiler for each method. In addition, the machine instruction page is annotated with the CPU use at each instruction (ticks). The third page for each method is the “callers of this method” page, displayed as a call graph sorted on the CPU consumption on each edge. You may want to increase FETCHCOUNT to 10 to get more information about the top methods executing. Here is what is in the ZVRobot.props file:  ZVRobotVars.TickProfilePage.FETCHCOUNT=5 You will not be using this:  ZVRobotVars.PollOpsPage.FETCHCOUNT=5 Further down in the file we have the pages that will be collected, represented as URIs to the servlets that provide the XML pages. Use these, as is:  ZVRobotPage.CONFIG_PROCESS=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/config/process ${SECONDS}\nZVRobotPage.ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/config/environment_variables ${SECONDS} 1 The most important one for this analysis:  ZVRobotPage.TICKS_PROFILE_DEFAULTVIEW=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/ticks/profile ${SECONDS} ${COUNT} Selecting these depends on how invasive you want to be for the information. The stack trace is very expensive. You can comment them out or reduce the frequency by replacing ${SECONDS} with 120, 180, … or even larger values.  ZVRobotPage.THREADS_LIST=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/threads/list?byname=&bystatus=any&stride=${THSIZE} ${SECONDS} ${COUNT} ZVRobotPage.THREADS_STACK_TRACE=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/threads/stack_trace?detail=low&byname=&bystatus=any&stride=${THSIZE} ${SECONDS} ${COUNT} The lock information is cumulative so you do not need to have fine granularity.  ZVRobotPage.THREADS_MONITOR_CONTENTION=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/monitors/contention ${SECONDS} ${COUNT} This information is in the GC log file, so you can comment them out as shown:  # ZVRobotPage.MEMORY_SUMMARY=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/memory/summary ${SECONDS} ${COUNT}\n# ZVRobotPage.MEMORY_GC_SUMMARY=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/memory/gc_summary ${SECONDS} ${COUNT}\n# ZVRobotPage.MEMORY_GC_HISTORY=http://${HOST}:${PORT}/memory/gc_history ${SECONDS} ${COUNT}"

To organize your data collection efforts, the first step is to supply the options to add the metrics to a file. The logging command line options provide you that capability.

Method includes exception handling The compilers make assumptions about the class hierarchy and the values of frequently used variables, if possible, to provide higher levels of optimization. At the beginning of an application’s execution, the compilers try to compile methods quickly to improve performance, but sometimes these assumptions are invalidated. The compiler runtime must recompile the method with the new environmental assumptions. The task of switching execution from the compiled code for that method to either the interpreter or a method with a lower level of optimization is called deoptimization. To track deoptimizations, use the command line option:  -XX:+TraceDeoptimization Inlining called methods in the caller is one of the most beneficial optimizations done by the compilers. Call overhead to the called methods is eliminated and the inlining provides a larger block of code over which optimizations can be performed. To see the inlining decisions made by the compiler, use the command line option:  -XX:+PrintInlining A warning – the output generated when using this option can be very verbose."

Without this optional fixup pass, references are still fixed, but the fixup is done lazily, and will completed by the next GC cycle. To enable the fixup pass, use the -XX:+GPGCDoFixupPasses command-line option. The JIT compiler has an optional optimization mode called \"FixupBasedLvbCodeVersioning\", which attempts to take advantage of the optional GC fixup phase. This mode can be enabled by using the -XX:+FixupBasedLvbCodeVersioning command-line option. When applied, generated code may avoid certain checks when GC cycles are not running, resulting in faster code. Setting -XX:+FixupBasedLvbCodeVersioning implicitly sets -XX:+GPGCDoFixupPasses."

  "content" : "Generating jHiccup Log Files To understand the impact of JVM runtime pauses, follow this example of the process of collecting and evaluating the jHiccup data. Install and configure the application you wish to test. For this example, you can use a test in the DaCapo benchmark suite. This suite is intended as a tool for Java benchmarking and consists of a set of open source applications with non-trivial workloads. The benchmark suite can be downloaded from https://dacapobench.org/. Use the h2 benchmark test, a JDBCbench-like in-memory benchmark that executes transactions against a model of bank data. The benchmark is run using the following command:  java -Xmx8g -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -jar dacapo-9.12-bach.jar \\\n-n 20 -s huge h2 This command will perform twenty iterations of the benchmark using the huge dataset ensuring that it runs long enough to exercise the JVM at an acceptable level. When monitoring your own application you should select a configuration and length of time that will give throughput results representative of those you obtain in your production environment. Download the jHiccup application and obtain more details about jHiccup at: https://www.azul.com/products/components/jhiccup/. Extract the archive in a suitable directory. Version-specific information is available in the accompanying README file. jHiccup can be used in one of three ways: Start as a Java agent (recommended) java -javaagent:<path-to-jar>/jHiccup.jar java-application Use the environment variable _JAVA_OPTIONS in a complex environment: export _JAVA_OPTIONS=-javaagent:<path-to-jar>/jHiccup.jar Start application using jHiccup shell script jHiccup java-application Determine which is the best approach for your application. Typically, you will modify your application startup script to use one of the two methods. For our example, we will use the second method, so our command line becomes:  jHiccup $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -Xmx8g -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -jar \\\ndacapo-9.12-bach.jar -n 20 -s huge h2 If you are using the Oracle JDK, add -XX:+UseG1GC. You will need to run this test twice. For the first run, use your existing Java runtime (set via the JAVA_HOME environment variable or directly in your application startup script). For the second run, use the Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) by changing your JAVA_HOME environment variable and/or startup script appropriately. You will now have two histogram log (hlog) files with names of the form:  hiccup.<date>.<time>.<sub-second-time>.hlog"

  "content" : "Comparing JVM Runtime Pause Performance Now that we have created the histogram log files for both JVMs, we need a way to display the data. Azul created the HistogramLogAnalyzer tool to graph the results contained in one or more log files. Download a tar.gz or zip archive with the HistogramLogAnalyzer tool. Extract the archive in a suitable directory. Alternatively, you can download a source code from https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HistogramLogAnalyzer and build the tool. Start HistogramLogAnalyzer:  java -jar HistogramLogAnalyzer-1.0.3.jar You can also start the tool using the command line option, -f, to automatically open a file:  java -jar HistogramLogAnalyzer-1.0.3.jar -f file-name Following the example, click Open in the window, and navigate to the directory where your hlog files are located First select the log file generated using the Oracle HotSpot JVM. This will display the following two graphs: Upper Graph – Maximum Latency (Hiccups in this case) In Time Interval The upper graph shows the maximum hiccup for each time interval (5 seconds by default) as the application ran. The x-axis is the elapsed execution time for the application. The y-axis represents the maximum duration of hiccups in a given interval. These are the maximum pauses for the interval that an end user would experience when using the application. The pattern of the hiccups suggests that garbage collections have a significant impact on pause/hiccup durations – a series of pauses for minor collections followed by a longer pause for a major collection. Lower Graph – Latency (Hiccups) by Percentile Distribution The lower graph shows the hiccup times for the application in percentiles. Use this graph to assess whether your application meets a defined service level agreement (SLA) for response times. SLAs are frequently specified in the form, “this application must respond within 20 milliseconds 99.99% of the time”. An application with this SLA could have a single pause of 100 milliseconds during its run of several hours. For that case, despite the maximum pause being significantly longer than the required SLA maximum, it does not do so more than 0.01% of the time. However, if there are frequent pauses of 30 milliseconds this could break the SLA. The lower graph makes it easy to see the percentile at which the application goes above a certain threshold. In the graph, the 99.99th percentile is 1250 milliseconds. Comparing Hiccup Files For comparison, we can add a second set of data in a file generated using the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Again, click on Open, navigate, if necessary, to the directory containing the histogram log file generated using the Azul Zulu Prime JVM VM and select it. A pop-up dialog box will ask you if you want to open this log in the same tab. Select ‘yes’. The tool will now display the following: This provides an easy way to compare hiccup times when your application is run using your current JVM and the Azul Zulu Prime JVM VM. Clearly, the hiccups measured when running the Azul Zulu Prime JVM VM are shorter, with a maximum hiccup of 43 milliseconds and a 99.99th percentile of 20 milliseconds. The following table compares the two JVMs. JVM 99.99th Percentile (ms) Maximum Hiccup (ms) Oracle HotSpot 1250 1600 Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20 43"

For that case, despite the maximum pause being significantly longer than the required SLA maximum, it does not do so more than 0.01% of the time. However, if there are frequent pauses of 30 milliseconds this could break the SLA. The lower graph makes it easy to see the percentile at which the application goes above a certain threshold. In the graph, the 99.99th percentile is 1250 milliseconds."

  "content" : "This section lists common errors and possible solutions when using Azul Platform Prime to run your Java applications: Zing Error: Running without ZST requires memfd_create(2), which is not supported by this version of the operating system. Zing JVM Error: See documentation for more details. The error message is displayed when running Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) on your machine with an unsupported kernel or operating system. Solution: Install the ZST component, see Installing the Azul Zulu Prime System Tools for related installation details. AzulZing Error: libcurl.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory When running zing-licensed --configure on Ubuntu 16.04, the following error message displays: zing-licensed --configure Zing Error: libcurl.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory ERROR: Please install libcurl package with 'libcurl.so.3' or 'libcurl.so.4' Solution: Install libcurl3 package. cd /usr/lib/zing ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.3 libcurl.so.3 ldconfig zing-licensed --c Cannot overwrite /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern When abrtd running zing core_pattern cannot overwrite /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern. Solution: Scan the file, core_pattern, for any reference piped ( \\| ) core_pattern. For example:  $ more /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern\n\n\\|/usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp /var/spool/abrt %s %c %p %u %g %t %h %e 636f726500 If a piped ( \\| ) core_pattern is found: Stop the process included in core_pattern. For example: $ service abrtd stop For RHEL 6.3: # service abrt-ccpp stop Clear or change core-pattern to not include any piped (\\|) core pattern. $ echo core > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern Restart zing-core-pattern. $ /etc/init.d/zing-core-pattern start Ensure the piped ( \\| ) core-pattern process is not restarted on boot. $ chkconfig abrdt off For RHEL 6.3: $ chkconfig abrt-ccpp off The Event Tick Buffer Profiling system status is: \"Shutdown.\" The tick profiler shutdowns automatically when an attempt is made to allocate more than the configured maximum number of tick profiling buffers. The reason is printed: Max Buffers Exceeded. Solution: Increase the maximum number of permissible tick profiling buffers by increasing the value of EventTickBuffersMaxAllocatedBeforeShutoff in the command line arguments. To avoid data structure resizes, use EventTickBuffersAllocated to simultaneously increase the chunk size used at initialization and for expansion. For example: java -XX:ARTAPort=9990 –XX:+UseTickProfiling -XX:EventTickBuffersAllocated=4096 -XX:EventTickBuffersMaxAllocatedBeforeShutoff=12288 <java-class> For best performance, keep the number of threads in the application to a reasonable number based on the CPU resources available. Crash When Using Tight Polling Loops Application hangs, and eventually crashes with a checkpoint timeout, when real time threads run tight loops. Background: In these conditions, lower priority threads are not getting sufficient CPU time to reach checkpoint. Solution: When the parameter CheckpointBoostPriority is configured, Azul Zulu Prime JVM temporarily boosts the priority of real time threads to the configured value. For example, one way to use this safely includes: Configure -XX:CheckpointBoostPriority=<Y> Start the Azul Zulu Prime JVM on node 0 with SCJED_RR and a priority, <X>, ensuring that the value for <X> is greater than <Y>. Using JNI, move the threads with relative real time priority requirements to node 1. Using JNI, assign relative priorities to the threads you moved to node 1, so that the highest among them is <Y>. Out of Space KlassTable The OOP (Ordinary Object Pointer) Table - KlassTable contains a unique ID for each loaded class. Each entry is 8 bytes long. The entries will be freed when the corresponding classes are unloaded. Solution: The KlassTableSize option needs to be set appropriately for the number of live classes in the application, which can be monitored using PrintGCDetails. The default value of KlassTableSize is based on the Java heap size, For example: Java heaps less than 2 GB - default 2 MB Java heaps 2 GB or greater - default 8 MB Dependency on the JNIDetachThreadsIfNotDetached flag The flag -XX:+JNIDetachThreadsIfNotDetached is needed by any application that attaches a JNI thread to the VM but does not detach the thread before calling pthread_exit. For example with IBM WebSphere MQ Low Latency Messaging (LLM) applications. If this error occurs, an error report file with more information is saved in, for example, /home/<user>/tmp5/hs_err_pid16620.log. Solution: If you receive this error, include the following flag in your Azul Zulu Prime JVM command: -XX:+JNIDetachThreadsIfNotDetached Problems when uninstalling or upgrading Azul Zulu Prime JVM You must stop all Azul Zulu Prime JVM Java processes before uninstalling or upgrading. Otherwise, you might see the following error message: %preun(zing-zst-<version>) scriptlet failed, exit status1 Solution: Run the zing-ps tool to list any running Azul Zulu Prime JVM processes. Stop the processes. Re-run zing-ps to verify all Azul Zulu Prime JVM processes are stopped. Reissue the uninstallation or upgrade commands. Could not create the Java virtual machine ZST is either not loaded properly or has not been configured yet. Solution: Please confirm the zing-zst package is properly installed and configured. Please run system-config-zing-memory as root. See man zing-installation for more information. Fatal error: Not enough free memory Running Linux processes are taking up a large amount of memory while attempting to configure Azul Platform Prime memory. Or, you have selected values that are too aggressive using the wizard or directly in the pmem.conf configuration file. Solution 1: Stop any processes that use significant resources while configuring Azul Platform Prime. You need to reevaluate your resource budget if you plan to run these concurrently with Azul Platform Prime. Solution 2: Try again with less aggressive memory settings. ZST Fails to Allocate Requested Memory Long after system startup (and after much memory has been consumed back and forth), ZST might fail to allocate the requested amount of memory, as it might (a) already be occupied or (b) exist in fragmented state that cannot be defragmented into 2MB pages. Transparent huge pages on RHEL 6.x can help recover 2MB pages, but might not be absolutely reliable, and on other systems (RHEL 5.x, SUSE 11, and other non-RHEL-6 kernel prior to 2.6.38) it is unlikely that you can find 75% of system memory in 2MB page form after the system has run loads for a while and cached files. Solution: See Enhanced Linux Memory Defragmentation. Cannot find kernel config/boot/config-<kernel version> The kernel you are running has no associated configuration file in the system /boot directory. A normal kernel installation and build will always include such a file. This is a serious error indicating that you are running a kernel in a non-standard way. Solution: You are likely using a non-supported system configuration. The solution is to use a standard configuration. Running Azul Platform Prime on Paravirtualized Kernels Kernel panic occurs when you are starting Azul Platform Prime on a paravirtualized instance. Explanation: Xen virtualization and in Amazon EC2 environments, paravirtualization is not supported in Azul Platform Prime. Only HVM (Hardware-assisted Virtual Machine) instances are supported. See the Azul Platform Prime System Requirements document for the complete list of the supported operating systems and kernels. UseLargePages Not Supported with ZST Azul Platform Prime does not support the -XX:+UseLargePages option. Azul Platform Prime pages are always large pages and they come from the ZST. ZST and the HugePages memory conflict, as they both reserve memory for themselves. The ZST memory service reserves and manages its own memory space, so Large Memory Pages configured by the operating system make it difficult or impossible for the ZST memory service to reserve enough pages for Azul Platform Prime. Therefore, set the output from the three Huge variables to zero. Solution: To set the huge variables to zero: Check if your system can support large page memory: # cat /proc/meminfo \\| grep Huge If Large Pages are available but not configured or reserved, the response is similar to:  # cat /proc/meminfo \\| grep Huge\nHugePages_Total: 0\nHugePages_Free: 0\nHugepagesize: 2048 kB If Large Pages are available, configured, and reserved, the response is similar to the following.  # cat /proc/meminfo \\| grep Huge\nHugePages_Total: 30000\nHugePages_Free: 264\nHugePages_Rsvd: 88\nHugepagesize: 2048 kB Set the operating system hugepages memory settings to zero. Log in as root. Reset the hugepages value, type: # echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages Optionally, because the /proc values resets after reboot, set the value in an init script, such as rc.local or sysctl.conf. JVM Process is Killed by the Linux Out Of Memory Process Killer The reason for the killed process is the memory pressure the VM Balloon Driver creates by over-expanding its virtual balloon and consuming the memory used by Azul Platform Prime. Sample error message:  java invoked oom-killer\nOut of memory: Kill process 6465 (java) score 38 or sacrifice child\nKilled process 6465 (java) total-vm: ... Solution Because the VM Balloon Driver is running on most standard Linux systems by default, it is recommended to disable the Balloon Driver by either of the following methods: For VMware, add the following line to the VMX file and restart the VM: sched.mem.maxmemctl = \"0\" Disable the balloon driver within the VM: Find the module name: /sbin/lsmod \\| grep balloon Remove the module: sudo modprobe -r vmw_balloon Problem running Azul Platform Prime on an unsupported kernel using reserve-at-launch You might encounter the following error when running ZST on an unsupported kernel using reserve-at-launch:  Enter reserve-at-(c)onfig or reserve-at-(l)aunch [default 'c']: l\nZing supports only the 'reserve-at-config' policy with the OS/kernel version\non this system. To override, please refer to the Zing documentation. This error might occur because the system-config-zing-memory script needs to identify if the kernel supports node compaction or not. Solution: To bypass the corresponding check: Login to your host system as root administrator or use sudo. Create an empty file named force_reserve_at_launch in the /etc/zing directory. Problem starting Azul Platform Prime memory (Syslog.pm) You might encounter the following error when trying to start Azul Platform Prime memory on Azul Linux:  zing-memory: INFO: Starting...\nCan't locate Sys/Syslog.pm Solution: Ensure you have installed the following packages are installed:  yum localinstall --nogpgcheck openssl binutils curl\nyum install perl-Sys-Syslog.x86_64 Problem starting Azul Platform Prime memory (Kernel update) You might encounter the following error when trying to start Azul Platform Prime memory:  zing-memory: INFO: Starting...\n/usr/lib/zing/bin/tar: zm.o_<kernel>: Not found in archive\n/usr/lib/zing/bin/tar: zm_linux.o_<kernel>: Not found in archive\n/usr/lib/zing/bin/tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors\nzing-memory: INFO: Zing ZST support for kernel <kernel> is unavailable. Please upgrade ZST. Solution: Upgrade ZST as described in Upgrading Azul Zulu Prime System Tools. Problem running Azul Platform Prime on CoreOS You might encounter the following error when trying to run Azul Platform Prime on CoreOS:  Error response from daemon: linux runtime spec devices: error gathering device information while adding custom device \"/dev/zing_mm0\": lstat /dev/zing_mm0: no such file or directory\nError: failed to start containers: <container ID> Solution: Run the following commands on privileged container:  ln -s /run/systemd/journal/dev-log /dev/log\nservice zing-memory restart and the following command on the CoreOS host:  /lib/modules/zing-memory create_devices Fatal error: Checkpoint sync time longer than 50000 ms detected You might encounter the following error when observing high time-to-checkpoint or event time-to-checkpoint crashes:  fatal error: Checkpoint sync time longer than 50000 ms detected Before this fatal error, you must have seen several warnings when either 1 second, 20%, or 80% of CheckpointTimeout was reached:  Detected TTSP issue: start: nnn.nnn wait: nnn.nnn\nFor details on how to modify profiler configuration (for example, increase the timeout limit with -XX:CheckpointTimeoutDelay=100000 or turn off crashing with -XX:-DieOnSafepointTimeout), see Safepoint Profiler. Solutions: Use any from below to fix the error: If CPU load is high, make sure that no non-JVM processes are affecting CPU availability for JVM. If CPU load is high and JVM contributes a large portion of it, try -XX:+PromoteCheckpoints. Depending on the load specifics, forcing earlier promotions with additional -XX:CheckpointPromotionDelay=<ms> may give better results. However, setting it to a too low value may negatively affect latency, as working java threads will be stopped more frequently. If CPU utilization is far from saturation, contact [email protected]. <path>has not been configured as an alternative for java You might encounter the following error when updating information in the alternatives system:  update-alternatives --set java /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/bin/java\n/opt/zing/zing-jdk8/bin/java has not been configured as an alternative for java Solution: Use the full path to the zing-jdk directory. For example: update-alternatives --set java /opt/zing/zing-jdk1.8.0-19.04.0.0-7-x86_64/bin/java libjvm.so: no version information available (required by … impalad) The libjvm.so library has a dependency on the libstdc++ version 3.4.20 or higher. Solution: Upgrade libstdc++ to be greater than 3.4.20. Alternatively, resolve the library dependency by using the library that is shipped with Azul Platform Prime: append the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to libstdc path in zing-jdk (e.g., export libstdc LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBARARY_PATH:/opt/zing/zing-jdk8//jre/lib/amd64/server/../../../../etc/libc++/) and relaunch your application. Error: dl failure on line 1095  $ java -version\nError: dl failure on line 1095\nError: failed /opt/zing/zing-jdk1.8.0-19.10.0.0-6-x86_64/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so, because libpam.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory* This error message is displayed when running Azul Platform Prime on containers due to a missing pam library.

Solution: If you received this error message, install GPG: $ sudo apt install gpg [-UseZST][ERROR] Could not find a suitable mount point for the backing storage  Error occurred during initialization of VM\nFailed to initialize memory management system This error can occur when migrating from a system where a JVM was configured to use static large pages. Solution: To check if a number of static large pages were previously configured on this system, run the following command to list the number of 2MByte pages: sysctl vm.nr_hugepages If no large pages are configured, remove -XX:+UseLargePages from your java command line. If large pages are configured and performance tests show a benefit for your application, refer to Using Huge Pages with Azul Platform Prime for information about enabling transparent huge pages. If Using Huge Pages with Azul Platform Prime is not applicable to your use case, use -XX:GPGCNoZSTBackingStoragePath. See Using Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK Command-Line Options for details. Error occurred during initialization of VM: Memory management: unable to fund java heap account The error message displays for both ZST and non-ZST modes of Azul Platform Prime at startup in the following cases: In ZST reserve-at-config mode, when there is not enough memory left in the ZST partition to fund the whole of Xmx. Here the solution is to increase the ZST partition or reduce Xmx or stop other running Azul Platform Prime processes. In ZST reserve-at-launch mode, when ZST memory could not be extended sufficiently to fund the whole of Xmx. Here the solution is to add more memory or increase the overall limit for ZST memory or reduce Xmx or stop other running processes. In non-ZST mode with -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch, when the whole of Xmx cannot be funded from the system. Solution: Add more memory, reduce Xmx, or stop other running processes. [-UseZST][ERROR] Available physical memory is not enough to fund the backing storage  Error occurred during initialization of VM\nFailed to initialize memory management system This error message is displayed in the non-ZST mode if the JVM detects at startup that there is not enough memory available on the system to fund the whole of Xmx. Solution: Add more memory, reduce Xmx, or stop other running processes. [ERROR] Mapping to backing storage failed with errno 12  An unexpected error has been detected by Java Runtime Environment:\nInternal Error (vmem_spaceManager.cpp:309), pid=63145, tid=63236\nExternal Fatal Error: Multimap to aliases failed during multimap_from_space Insufficient virtual memory areas (VMA) may lead to a crash in Azul Platform Prime. Solution: Increase the VMA as described in Ensuring Sufficient Virtual Memory Areas. Exception: Too many open files The error is generated when the open file limit for a user or system exceeds the default setting. Solution: Increase the open files limit on your system. System-wide settings View the current limit value for maximum open files at the system level: # cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max To change the system-wide maximum open files limit, edit your /etc/sysctl.conf file as root and add the following line at the end of the file: fs.file-max = <num> To activate your change in the live system, run the following command: sysctl -p User settings To check the current limit value for maximum open files for a user, run the following commands as root:  $ su - <user>\n$ ulimit -n The default setting is usually 1024. Change the open files limit for either a specific user or all users as described below. To change the open files limit for a specific user, edit /etc/security/limits.conf as root: user - nofile <num> To increase the system-wide limit for all users, edit the /etc/security/limits.conf file as root: nofile <num> To apply your changes in the limits.conf file, close all active sessions, log back in, and restart your application. Note: The <num> value varies according to the amount of RAM in the system. It is approximately 100000 files per GB of RAM."

This is usually written in C/C++ and contains the “main” function to start execution. Invoking Native Launch with Azul Zulu Prime JVM If Native (C/C++) applications invoke Azul Zulu Prime JVM, consider these issues before you execute your code. Native launch application — Identify how the native app creates the VM to find possible collisions with areas used by or allocated by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Consider known limitations when running native apps on Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Identify the issues by the failure messages. Invoking the Azul Zulu Prime JVM — check for differences between a stock build and a Azul Zulu Prime JVM build. Native apps should also know how to run Azul Zulu Prime JVM specific features such as the Tick Profiler mechanism and C-Heap Leak detection. Consult the cases listed below to determine your best course of action: Bad address errors for CodeCache and OopTable: temporary az_mreserve failed.  Failure message: Error: temporary az_mreserve(CodeCache) failed: Bad address  at (0xNNNNNN for 0xNNNNNN bytes)\nFailure message: Error: temporary az_mreserve(OopTable) failed: Bad address  at (0xNNNNNN for 0xNNNNNN bytes) Virtual address space collisions when native launch applications allocate memory where Azul Zulu Prime JVM allocates certain internal structures like the CodeCache and the OopTable. Solution: If any of the reported messages are encountered, native launch applications should try to LD_PRELOAD libc_hooks3.so or call JNI_CreateJavaVM early on in the main function before calling routines that may allocate memory. libc_hooks3.so is available in $JAVA_ HOME/etc/zing/lib/. Problems using signal handlers Native launch application uses signal handlers for signals used by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. Solution: Please use libjsig.so to chain user signal handlers correctly behind the Azul Zulu Prime JVM’s signal handlers. libjsig.so is available under $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjsig.so. Dependency on libc_hooks3.so or LD_PRELOAD libc_hooks3.so Native launch applications will have to link against libc_hooks3.so or LD_PRELOAD libc_hooks3.so in the following scenarios: When using -XX:+UseTickProfiler When using -XX:+CHeapLeakDetection When there is a collision in the low 2 GB of virtual address space Solution: Applications can either modify the code to load libjvm.so early or load libc_hooks3.so, which will reserve upfront the space needed for the VM in the low 2 GB of virtual address space. libc_hooks3.so is available in $JAVA_HOME/etc/zing/lib/. Threads can come under the tick profiler scanner and allocations can come under the leak detection scanner only after VM initialization. Note Starting with the Azul Zulu Prime JVM 18.12.0.0 release, native applications linked with libc_hooks2 will fail. To avoid the failure, rebuild your native application with libc_hooks3 which is in <JAVA_HOME>/etc/zing/lib."

  "content" : "Consider the following recommendations related to the Azul Platform Prime hardware requirements. Limitation Description Recommendation Processor support insufficient for Azul Platform Prime (constant_tsc support required) Azul Platform Prime requires a specific feature of modern X86 chips in order to function properly. This feature, constant_tsc, provides a reliable, fast time-source even in the presence of power-saving operations performed by modern processors. This reliable time source is required by Azul Platform Prime. Solution: Run Azul Platform Prime on a processor supporting constant_tsc. Nearly all server-class X86 processors made in the last five years have this feature. See the Azul Platform Prime System Requirements and Compatibility References for a list of supported processors. Known Intel chip errata can cause spurious system-wide delays. Recent Intel chips in combination with some aggressive power-saving driver techniques are known to cause sporadic system lockups, up to a minute long. This is an issue which can occur with or without Azul Platform Prime present but can be more noticeably manifest in the high-performance, low-latency applications commonly deployed in Azul Platform Prime environments. This issue appears with RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.1 and its integrated Intel Idle Driver. The Intel Idle Driver aims to improve power efficiency but can lead to system lockups when run on some recent Intel CPUs (some Nehalems and Westmeres have been reported to have problems). Note that this issue does not occur on all Nehalem and Westmere processors. Solution: To solve the issue, you can simply boot your system with the Intel idle driver disabled. To do so, modify your kernel boot parameters and add the argument intel_idle.max_cstate=0 to the boot line. See Disabling the Intel Idle Driver for directions on RHEL, SUSE, and Ubuntu systems."

  "content" : "If you contact your Azul technical support representative regarding a failure, you might be asked to provide core files or a core bundle that includes the core files and crash associated files, (such as, log files generated by the Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) instance, system log files, and versions of shared libraries used by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance). Providing this information, in addition to the core files, helps Azul to properly diagnose and quickly identify failures due to Azul Platform Prime. If a failure occurs due to a Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance or Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance-related Java application failure a core file is created, provided ulimit -c unlimited is set. The uli`m`it setting is required to generate a core file. Use the following two scripts for bundling the core files with the shared libraries that were in use by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running the Java application when it failed: core-bundler (introduced in Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.06.0.0 for improved work with Docker containers) zing-core-bundler (a previous version of the script)"

  "content" : "About the core-bundler Script The core-bundler script is a self-contained bash script introduced in the Azul Platform Prime 19.06.0.0. It works well in a container environment. When the Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) crashes, a core file is dumped on a disk (if core dump is configured and enabled). See Core Bundling with Azul Platform Prime for more information. The core-bundler script is used to create an encrypted bundle containing the core file along with object files used by the crashed application and log files produced by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM. It collects and bundles the core file along with the dynamic libraries to an encrypted gzipped tarball (.tgz.gpg) archive. core-bundler requires gpg, gtar/tar, pigz/gzip, gawk/awk. The core-bundler script does not require installation and is located in the <zvm installation directory>/etc/core-bundler directory once the Azul Zulu Prime JVM is installed on your system. Using core-bundler The core-bundler syntax and options are listed below. Usage:  core-bundler -h|--help\ncore-bundler <command> <args> Command Description create Creates an encrypted archive with files needed to successfully debug the core dump. extract Extracts an encrypted core bundle to the current directory. help Provides information about a specific command usage. Creating an Encrypted Bundle To create a bundle, use the core-bundler create command:  core-bundler create [--hsfile <hsfile>] [--docker-container <cid> | --docker-image <iid> [-v <vlist> ...]] [<force-options> ...] <core> Option Description <core> Specifies the path to the core file to create a bundle for. <hsfile> Specifies the path to the hs_err log file left by the same VM process. Default: hs_err fileis in the same directory as the corefile. <cid> Docker container ID of the container that dumped the core or of a similar container (if the original one is not available). <iid> Docker image ID of the image that can be used to create a container similar to the one that dumped the core. <vlist> Docker volumes mount list (in the format of -v <src>:<dst>). Multiple -v options allowed. <force-options> core-bundler is interactive by default but you can force some/all actions by providing the following options: --no-host-check forces bundling on the current host even if it differs from the host where coredump was produced --no-preview does not open an EDITOR to preview the list of files to bundle --no-space-check does not perform a free disk space check --overwrite overwrites the bundle if a file with the same name already exists For example:  $ /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/etc/core-bundler create core.57075\ncore-bundler version 0.3\nExtracting hostname from the core file.

Extracting an Encrypted Bundle The password file that is created next to the bundle file can be used to decode/extract files from the bundle. To extract an archive, use the core-bundler extract command:  core-bundler extract [--list-only] <encrypted-bundle> Option Description <encrypted-bundle> Specifies the path to the encrypted bundle (corelibs.xxxx.tgz.gpg). --list-only Does not extract files. Lists the archive content only. For example:  $ /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/etc/core-bundler create /tmp/corelibs.57075_testhost.tgz.gpg\ncore-bundler version 0.3\nExtracting data from /tmp/corelibs.57075_testhost.tgz.gpg ... Done The above command extracts the content of the bundle to the current directory. Dealing with Core Files from Docker Container Environment Core files dumped by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM while running in a container need to be co-bundled with the same dynamic libraries that were used by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM during the crashed run. So the core-bundler script needs a way to access files from the container. If the Docker container is either still alive or was started without the --rm option, one can use the --docker-container <cid> option to pass the ID of the container to the script. In this case, the script will auto-detect all the mappings that are used by the container and prepare a bundle: For example:  $ /opt/zing/zing-jdk8/etc/core-bundler create core.15 --docker-container 123abc456def\ncore-bundler version 0.3\nThe bundle file will contain core file, log files, executable, dynamic libraries and some system information.\nFor security reasons the bundle will be encrypted.\nDo you want to review (and/or modify) list of files to be included before proceeding?

If the container is not available, you can use the --docker-image option to specify an image ID that could be used to re-create the environment used during the crashed run. It is important to provide an image that has the same set of dynamic libraries installed. Ideally, it should be the same image that the container was created from. Note, that in this case the script has no information about Docker Volumes mappings. So you have to provide them with -v <vlist> option(s): For example:  $ core-bundler create core.15 --docker-image fed654cba321 -v /tmp:/cores -v /home/user/data:/data --no-preview\ncore-bundler version 0.3\nCreating an encrypted bundle: /tmp/corelibs.15_45e64c65dd4b.tgz.gpg ...\nEncrypted bundle file has been created and is ready to be shared with Azul!\nFile: /tmp/corelibs.15_45e64c65dd4b.tgz.gpg\nPLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD THE PASSWORD FILE TO AZUL *\nAzul already has a private key which can decrypt the core bundle.\nThe password is only for your use, in case YOU need to extract files from the bundle.\nTo extract the file use core-bundler extract corelibs.15_45e64c65dd4b.tgz.gpg."

  "content" : "About the zing-core-bundler Script This section describes the zing-core-bundler script. Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) Core Bundling If automatic core bundling is not enabled, you can manually bundle the core files with the shared libraries that were in use by the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running the Java application when it failed. If you are running a system based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 or CentOS Linux 5.2, the automatic core bundler is not on, so core files need to be bundled manually. For this purpose the script zing-core-bundler is provided. This script, as part of the ZST installation, is located in the /usr/sbin subdirectory of the ZST installation. The zing-core-bundler bundles the required files needed to debug a Azul Zulu Prime JVM core. It assembles, collects, and bundles the core file along with the shared objects, data, and executable files in-use to an encrypted gzipped tarball (.tgz.gpg) archive. To manually bundle the core file with shared libraries: On RHEL, SLES, and Ubuntu systems, ensure the development tools package group is installed.  yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' Note Selected development tools are required to bundle RHEL 5 core files. If they are not installed, the shared libraries, which were used at the time of the crash and are essential to processing the core file, are not included. Locate the core file. Core files are bundled and stored in the current working directory of the process that crashed. [NOTE]Typically, you create a core bundle on the system where the core file was created, for example host A. If you run the zing-core-bundler command with a copy of the core file on a different system, for example host B, then include the -bundle-on-current-host option. On Ubuntu systems, ensure that the strings command is available. If it is not, install the package, binutils.  # apt-get install binutils If you use the jsvc tool to start your application, to generate Azul Platform Prime core files:  # kill -SIGABRT <PID> Ensure /usr/sbin is in your Azul Zulu Prime JVM executable path. For example, add the follwing to appropriate profile file:  export PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH Run the zing-core-bundler command. Go to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM host command line where ZST is installed. To create a bundle with only related shared libraries that does not include the .jar files, run:  $ /usr/sbin/zing-core-bundler -core core<pid> For example:  $ /usr/sbin/zing-core-bundler -core core.1234 -getall -hsfile hs_err_pid1234.log A compressed and encrypted tar file ending in .tgz.gpg is returned. In this example, the package contains the core file, the .jar files, and because the -getall option is specified, it also contains the related shared libraries which were used in the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running the Java application. The -getall option ensures the bundle contains all application related data including the .jar files. The -hsfile option creates an additional file that provides additional information useful for support to identify issues. Locate the bundled libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg file. The libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg file is created in the current directory. For example, if you execute the command from /home/test, the bundled libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg file is created in /home/test. Ensure you have write permissions in the executing directory (i.e. /home/test). Send the generated bundle to Azul for failure analysis. Note Encryption error If there is a file with the same name as the core bundle, the core bundle will not be encrypted and the following message is displayed in the core bundling response. INFO: Encrypting core bundle libs.1234.tgz … gpg: libs.1234.tgz: encryption failed: File exists ERROR: Encryption failed. Warning Core bundle is not encrypted INFO: Core bundle at libs.1234.tgz Bundler host error Typically, you create the bundle on the same system where the core file was created. If you are not creating the bundle on the originating core file system, and you did not specify the required option, the following message is displayed in the core bundling response. ERROR: The bundler must run on host <hostname> ERROR: Use the argument '-bundle-on-current-host' to bundle on this host To create the bundle on a different system: Copy the core file from the originating core file system (host A) to host B. On host B, include the -bundle-on-current-host option when you run the zing-core-bundler command. The zing-core-bundler syntax and options are listed below. Option Description -core Specify the core file to be bundled. -bundle-on-current-host Create bundle on current host. This allows bundling a core file that was generated on another host. -exepath Specify the path of the binary that was used to invoke Azul Zulu Prime JVM. -decrypt Specify file to decrypt -getall Include all possible files associated with the crash. This includes shared objects, data, and executable files. -getexe Include non-java executable with the bundle. This is bundled if it is available on the host at the time of bundling. -hsfile Explicitly specify the path of the hs_err file. -passwordfile Specify decryption password file. -help Print options help. -output-dir | -o Bundle will be produced at the location specified. Decrypting Core Files Core bundles created through zing-core-pattern, whether they are automatically or manually created and bundled, are encrypted. Files contained in the core bundle are not encrypted individually. The core bundle filename format is: libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg, where <corepid> is a unique ID specific to the process that encountered an error and crashed. Note Core files are not encrypted if zing-core-pattern is disabled. To decrypt the Azul Zulu Prime JVM core bundle: Locate the core bundle file. Run the command:  $ /usr/sbin/zing-core-bundler –decrypt libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg For example:  $ /usr/sbin/zing-core-bundler -decrypt libs.12830.tgz.gpg\nINFO: Decrypting file libs.12830.tgz.gpg\ngpg: CAST5 encrypted session key\ngpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase\ngpg: encrypted with RSA key, ID 2934892D\nSUCCESS: Decrypted file libs.12830.tgz Core Bundling with Docker Containers You can select one of the following options to collect core dumps from the Docker container: Option 1 Install zing-core-pattern to dump and bundle cores while using docker:  # system-config-zing-core-pattern enable Bundles will be kept under /var/crash/<docker_container_id> on the host. Option 2 Use zing-core-bundler script to bundle the core dumped by a docker container process:  # zing-core-bundler -c <core> --dockercontainerid <docker_container_id>"

If you are running a system based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 or CentOS Linux 5.2, the automatic core bundler is not on, so core files need to be bundled manually. For this purpose the script zing-core-bundler is provided. This script, as part of the ZST installation, is located in the /usr/sbin subdirectory of the ZST installation. The zing-core-bundler bundles the required files needed to debug a Azul Zulu Prime JVM core. It assembles, collects, and bundles the core file along with the shared objects, data, and executable files in-use to an encrypted gzipped tarball (.tgz.gpg) archive. To manually bundle the core file with shared libraries: On RHEL, SLES, and Ubuntu systems, ensure the development tools package group is installed.  yum groupinstall 'Development Tools' Note Selected development tools are required to bundle RHEL 5 core files. If they are not installed, the shared libraries, which were used at the time of the crash and are essential to processing the core file, are not included. Locate the core file. Core files are bundled and stored in the current working directory of the process that crashed. [NOTE]Typically, you create a core bundle on the system where the core file was created, for example host A. If you run the zing-core-bundler command with a copy of the core file on a different system, for example host B, then include the -bundle-on-current-host option. On Ubuntu systems, ensure that the strings command is available. If it is not, install the package, binutils.  # apt-get install binutils If you use the jsvc tool to start your application, to generate Azul Platform Prime core files:  # kill -SIGABRT <PID> Ensure /usr/sbin is in your Azul Zulu Prime JVM executable path. For example, add the follwing to appropriate profile file:  export PATH=/usr/sbin:$PATH Run the zing-core-bundler command. Go to the Azul Zulu Prime JVM host command line where ZST is installed. To create a bundle with only related shared libraries that does not include the .jar files, run:  $ /usr/sbin/zing-core-bundler -core core<pid> For example:  $ /usr/sbin/zing-core-bundler -core core.1234 -getall -hsfile hs_err_pid1234.log A compressed and encrypted tar file ending in .tgz.gpg is returned. In this example, the package contains the core file, the .jar files, and because the -getall option is specified, it also contains the related shared libraries which were used in the Azul Zulu Prime JVM instance running the Java application. The -getall option ensures the bundle contains all application related data including the .jar files. The -hsfile option creates an additional file that provides additional information useful for support to identify issues. Locate the bundled libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg file. The libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg file is created in the current directory. For example, if you execute the command from /home/test, the bundled libs.<corepid>.tgz.gpg file is created in /home/test. Ensure you have write permissions in the executing directory (i.e. /home/test). Send the generated bundle to Azul for failure analysis. Note Encryption error If there is a file with the same name as the core bundle, the core bundle will not be encrypted and the following message is displayed in the core bundling response. INFO: Encrypting core bundle libs.1234.tgz … gpg: libs.1234.tgz: encryption failed: File exists ERROR: Encryption failed. Warning Core bundle is not encrypted INFO: Core bundle at libs.1234.tgz Bundler host error Typically, you create the bundle on the same system where the core file was created. If you are not creating the bundle on the originating core file system, and you did not specify the required option, the following message is displayed in the core bundling response. ERROR: The bundler must run on host <hostname> ERROR: Use the argument '-bundle-on-current-host' to bundle on this host To create the bundle on a different system: Copy the core file from the originating core file system (host A) to host B. On host B, include the -bundle-on-current-host option when you run the zing-core-bundler command. The zing-core-bundler syntax and options are listed below. Option Description -core Specify the core file to be bundled. -bundle-on-current-host Create bundle on current host. This allows bundling a core file that was generated on another host. -exepath Specify the path of the binary that was used to invoke Azul Zulu Prime JVM. -decrypt Specify file to decrypt -getall Include all possible files associated with the crash. This includes shared objects, data, and executable files. -getexe Include non-java executable with the bundle. This is bundled if it is available on the host at the time of bundling. -hsfile Explicitly specify the path of the hs_err file. -passwordfile Specify decryption password file. -help Print options help. -output-dir | -o Bundle will be produced at the location specified."

  "content" : "When generating crash associated files, you can use an option, -XX:+DumpMiniCore, that creates significantly smaller Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) core files. To adjust the size of the core file, use this option with the -XX:DumpMiniCoreLevel=<x> option. Where <x> specifies the information that is included in the mini core file. When you use this option: Generated Azul Zulu Prime JVM core files do not include application objects stored in the Java heap. Time required to produce a Azul Zulu Prime JVM core file or core file bundle is reduced. To further adjust the amount of data that is included in a mini-core file, include the option, -XX:DumpMiniCoreLevel=<x>, where <x> is in [0, 4]. Level 0 (the current default) includes page infos and audit records Level 1 includes marking information and the card tables Level 2 includes trampolines, forwarding hash tables, preallocated pages etc. Level 3 includes the heap mirror pages Level 4 includes the object heap itself The mini-core file -XX:+DumpMiniCore option requires ZST 5.7.5 or later and ZVM 5.10.x or later. The mini-core file level option, -XX:DumpMiniCoreLevel=<x>, requires ZST 5.7.11 or later and ZVM 15.05.0.0 or later. The default value of DumpMiniCore depends on the Xmx specified If Xmx >= 40g, the default is true (enabled); Otherwise the default is false (disabled). The default value of DumpMinICoreLevel is 0. If the option is specified and either the ZST version or ZVM version is not compatible, a message is issued. If the ZST version supports the -XX:+DumpMiniCore option, but the ZVM version does not, an Unrecognized VM option warning is printed to STDERR. For example:  <my dir>/jdk6/x86_64/product/bin/java -XX:+DumpMiniCore -version\nZing 64-Bit Tiered VM error: Unrecognized VM option '+DumpMiniCore'\nCould not create the Java virtual machine. If the ZVM version supports the -XX:+DumpMiniCore option, but the ZST version does not, a warning message is issued. For example:  $ /bin/java -jar -XX:+DumpMiniCore -version\nZing VM Warning: -XX:+DumpMiniCore is not supported by this ZST (found API version 0x5e, requires API version >= 0x5f)\njava version \"1.7.0-internal-zing_99.99.99.99.dev\"\nZing Runtime Environment for Java Applications (build 1.7.0-internal-zing_99.99.99.99.dev-b25)\nZing 64-Bit Tiered VM (build 1.7.0-zing_99.99.99.99.dev-b501-product-azlinuxM-X86_64, mixed mode) Include the option -XX:+DumpMiniCore, and optionally, -XX:DumpMiniCoreLevel=<x>, with your Java launch command. Some failures cannot be effectively diagnosed with a mini-core file. In this case, Azul support may request that you try to reproduce the failure and produce a full-sized core file, by removing -XX:+DumpMiniCore from your Java launch command. When -XX:+DumpMiniCore option is not specified, a full core file, including the application objects stored in the Java heap, is created if Azul Zulu Prime JVM crashes. When -XX:+DumpMiniCore option is specified, a core file, that does not include the application objects stored in the Java heap, is created if Azul Zulu Prime JVM crashes. When -XX:+DumpMiniCore and the -XX:DumpMiniCoreLevel=<x> options are specified, a core file, that includes the specified information, is created if Azul Zulu Prime JVM crashes."

When the Azul Zulu Prime JVM starts and a GC log is being created, information about the environment is printed to the log. The information includes the start time for the Azul Zulu Prime JVM process. If the file is very large and you are having trouble with memory use by GC Log Analyser then split the GC log file into smaller files that are easier to analyze.

  "content" : "X-axis Date and Time Options With the following options you can print help information about X-axis date and time command-line options, select date and time as the X-axis units, control the X-axis label orientation and correct for any issues with GC Log Analyser’s date and time auto-detection mechanism used to set the time zone when using the date-time values for the X-axis. Command-Line Option Description [-helpdate | -datehelp] Prints X-axis date and time use help message. [[{-et | -elapsedTimeUnits} date] | -useDateTimeXAxis | -usedatex] Uses date and time for the X-axis rather than elapsed time in units of milliseconds, seconds, minutes or hours. [{-useDateTimeXAxisLabelOrientation | -usedatexlabelorient} {vertical | horizontal}] Orients the X-axis date and time labels vertically or horizontally. Default orientation is vertical. [{-xAxisTimeZoneOffsetHrs | -xTimeOffsetHrs} \"real-number\"] The number of offset hours to obtain alignment of the times in the GC log file with times used by the graph. As a first approximation, the value that should be used is the difference between the UTC time zone where the GC log file was generated and the UTC time zone where gcLogAnalyser is being run. You should only need to use this option if gcLogAnalyser is not able to do the calculations correctly. Units for real-number are hours plus fractional hours. Example: File generated on machine with: India Standard Time UTC +5.5 gcLogAnalyser run on machine with: Eastern Standard Time UTC -5 Offset = IST - EST = 5.5 - (-5) = 10.5 Add option: -xAxisTimeZoneOffsetHrs 10.5 [{-dateMaxMSAdd | -dateTimeMaxMSToAddForDuplicateSeriesTimes} \"integer\"] When using the X-axis date and time graphs, the X value (elapsed time) for each point in a series must be unique at millisecond granularity. Data in the GC log file is collected with microsecond accuracy and multiple events can occur per millisecond. To resolve this issue and ensure that all data in a series is displayed, gcLogAnalyser adds a millisecond to the elapsed time value if the value is the same as the previous, hoping to find a unique value. Incrementing the elapsed time value can be repeated. The integer value (>0) provided using this option is the upper bound on the number of times to add a millisecond in an attempt to find a unique value. Default value is: 5 [-printDateTimeMessages {true | false}] Prints messages to stdout about the work done by gcLogAnalyser to process the X-axis values. The messages can include information about points with the same value for the X coordinate (gcLogAnalyser tries to plot them) and data series that are empty."

  "content" : "After ZST is installed you can configure Zing memory allocation. Zing requires a portion of host system memory to be set aside and managed independently from Linux. The system-config-zing-memory wizard assists with this. Note The system-config-zing-memory creates or replaces any existing version of the pmem.conf file. Running the system-config-zing-memory wizard is required for first time installations. This section describes creating a default configuration. To customize your Zing memory configuration, see Modifying Zing Memory Configuration. With ZST 5.20.x you still should run system-config-zing-memory after installation as otherwise different default settings compared to ZST 5.19 and earlier will be applied. Complete the steps in Install Zing System Tools. Configure Zing memory management using the system-config-zing-memory command. Zing requires a portion of host system memory to be set aside and managed independently from Linux. Use the system-config-zing-memory wizard for initial configuration. From the command line, type:  #system-config-zing-memory The system responds:  Welcome to the Zing memory configuration wizard by Azul Systems.\n\nThis wizard sets up the Zing memory configuration file\n\n/etc/zing/pmem.conf.0\n\nand initializes System Zing memory. Read the man pages for zing, zing-zst, and zing-pmem-conf for more information about this configuration file.)\n\nUse of System Zing Memory by Java processes running on the Zing VM requires you to configure memory in advance. This is analogous to reservation of memory for Linux hugepages, although System Zing Memory pages are not interchangeable with hugepages.\n\nFor most environments running Java applications on the Zing VM, Azul recommends configuring your system with 25% System Linux Memory and 75% System Zing Memory.\n\nChoose yes to accept this default, or no to enter the wizard expert flow.\n** accept default configuration\n** (y)es or (n)o [default 'y']: y Accept default configuration settings. At the prompt, type: y. The system response lists the zing services that are started or restarted and memory configuration information.

  "content" : "Azul Zulu Prime System Tools (ZST) is a component of Azul Platform Prime that allows you to coordinate memory usage between Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK (Azul Zulu Prime JVM) and the underlying Linux operating system. Azul Platform Prime’s C4 garbage collector works the same way, with or without ZST. ZST enables Azul Platform Prime to support larger heap sizes, and to provide better memory management on older operating system versions that don’t have the required functionality already built in. Generally, it is simpler to run Azul Platform Prime without ZST. Your operational overhead may be less complex without the need to manage ZST installation and configuration. However, there are some conditions which require the use of ZST, and there are some operational considerations which could also mean that ZST is a preference for you. As of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07, ZST becomes an optional component for Azul Platform Prime. With modern Linux kernels, the Linux kernel itself can provide most of the functionality that ZST provides. For most applications, the functionality now provided by modern Linux kernels is sufficient for good application performance on Azul Platform Prime, so we no longer require the use of ZST. However, there are some things that ZST can do that even the most modern Linux kernels can not, so in some cases, using ZST is still required, or desired if it gives better performance or simpler system management, and thus ZST remains an optional component for use with Azul Platform Prime."

  "url" : "https://docs.azul.com/prime/ZST.html",

  "content" : "Considerations There are three main ways to use Azul Platform Prime: Azul Zulu Prime JVM without ZST, Azul Zulu Prime JVM without ZST but with Transparent Huge Pages (THP) configured, or Azul Zulu Prime JVM with ZST (ZST provides it own memory management for large pages). Each of these has different minimum operating system requirements, so a table format may be helpful. Read on below the table for details about each of the considerations. Minimum Operating System versions to run Azul Platform Prime in each of these configuration types: Azul Platform Prime without ZST - Recommended if ZST is not otherwise required or beneficial. Azul Platform Prime without ZST, with Transparent Huge Pages - Recommended for heap sizes 100 GB or more or if lower throughput or reduced start time is seen without ZST. Azul Platform Prime with ZST - Required for heap sizes over 2.5 TB and for older operating systems. Useful in environments where you can’t otherwise guarantee available memory at application launch time Operating System Without ZST Without ZST, With Transparent Huge Pages With ZST Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 or later 8 or later 7 or later CentOS CentOS Linux 7.3 or later not supported 7 or later CentOS Stream 8 or later 8 or later 8 or later Oracle Linux UEK [1] 7.3 or later 7.6 or later 7 or later RHCK [2] 7.3 or later 8 or later 7 or later Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or later 18 or later 16.04 - 20.04 SLES 12 SP5 12 SPR or later 12 SP5 Debian 9 or later 10 or later 9 and 10 Amazon Linux 1, 2 Since 2018 1, 2 Amazon Linux 2023 all versions all versions not planned Note For technical questions about the table above, contact us at [email protected] More info about each of the considerations: Java heap size (-Xmx) ZST is required for heap size above 2.5 TB. If you don’t require heap sizes above 2.5 TB, you should try running without ZST if your operating system supports it. Note From Azul Zulu Prime JVM 19.07 to 20.03, the max heap size without ZST is 1 TB. As of Azul Zulu Prime JVM 20.04, the max heap size without ZST is 2.5 TB. Operating system version Using Azul Platform Prime without ZST requires the memfd_create(2) system call. This system call is available since mainline Linux 3.17. If you want to run Azul Platform Prime on an older operating system, you will have to use ZST. If your operating system supports running without ZST, you should try it. See System Requirements to verify minimum OS version requirements for Azul Platform Prime without ZST. See System Tools Requirements for minimum OS requirements for Azul Platform Prime with ZST. Large Pages For large heaps in the range of 100 GB or more, large memory pages (2 MB) are recommended to increase throughput performance and JVM start time. Most modern operating systems can meet this need with Transparent Huge Pages. If your application sees reduced throughput or JVM start time when you test with Azul Platform Prime without ZST, try using THP. If you find yourself in this situation and your operating system doesn’t support Transparent Huge Pages, then you can run Azul Platform Prime with ZST as ZST implements a more efficient memory manager for large pages than standard Linux and is recommended in these situations. See Enabling Huge Pages for more info. Reserved memory for your Java applications on Azul Platform Prime ZST can be used in reserve-at-config mode which reserves memory exclusively for use by Azul Zulu Prime JVM java process. Other processes using memory on the server will not be able to unexpectedly use up available memory on the host and impact your Azul Zulu Prime JVM application launches. An added benefit is the predictable application start time as you do not depend on Linux memory management at process start time when using ZST with \"reserve-at-config\". If you need to worry about other processes that might get run on the same host, you may prefer to use ZST to guarantee memory is always available for the Azul Platform Prime instances. If you don’t need to worry about other processes on the host, and the application is rarely restarted, this may be less of a concern for you and you may be fine without ZST, or with ZST using reserve-at-launch if ZST is used for other reasons. See Configuring Zing Memory with ZST for more info. If you don’t use ZST, here are some things you should consider and configure if needed: Enabling Huge Pages. For large heaps in the range of 100 GB or more, large memory pages (2 MB) are recommended to increase throughput performance and JVM start time. This can be enabled on all current modern operating systems. Increase vm.max_map_count If you still have questions about ZST and non-ZST mode, please contact us at [email protected]."

  "content" : "JIT Optimization JIT optimization provides a multitude of benefits, including the ability to use speculative optimizations that lead to faster eventual code. However, traditional on-JVM JIT compilers must share the JVMs local CPU resources and compete with the application logic in using that capacity. This presents several challenges: Optimization limitations: The JIT compiler is limited in resources. Resulting optimizations take time to arrive at, and benefits are limited by the practical amount of time that applications can wait for optimization and warm-up to complete. The JIT compiler is limited in how aggressively it can afford to optimize code. The resulting optimizations are not as fast as they could be if the optimizer had more resources available. Application performance limitations during warm-up: Optimization takes time to complete, and application code runs significantly slower and less efficiently until the JIT compilers optimize it. JIT compilation work competes with the application for resources. Not all CPU and memory resources are devoted to application threads. Resource allocation and utilization: Resources (CPU and memory capacity) used for JIT optimization are only needed and utilized during warm-up, which is a fraction of the overall lifetime of each Java process. Instances must reserve (and customers pay for) these under-utilized resources for the duration of the run of each application instance."

  "content" : "Falcon JIT Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK replace OpenJDK’s C2 JIT compiler with the Falcon JIT compiler. The Falcon JIT compiler can run different levels of optimizations, and its upper tier of optimizations produces optimized code that can run significantly faster than code produced by the OpenJDK C2 compiler. Using more aggressive optimization levels requires more resources, and when using JVM-local JIT compilers for optimization, resource tradeoffs can often lead to a choice of lowering optimization levels in favor of improved warmup times. Cloud Native Compiler eliminates these tradeoffs by removing JIT compilation work from individual JVMs, and shifting the work of the Falcon JIT compiler to a separate shared service. This shift of work and associated resources allows the Cloud Native Compiler to apply even the most aggressive Falcon JIT optimization levels without disrupting individual JVM behavior. The Cloud Native Compiler can bring to bear practically unlimited Falcon JIT compilation resources when a JVM needs them, and later scale those resources down when they are unused and unneeded. This results in JVMs that can consistently serve higher amounts of traffic in smaller footprint."

  "content" : "Optimizer Hub 1.9.0 Release Date: February 1, 2024 - Release Notes PDF New Features Cross-Region Synchronization of ReadyNow Orchestrator Profiles A new feature in ReadyNow Orchestrator allows you to synchronize profile names between Optimizer Hub instances in different regions so that each instance contains at least one promoted profile for each profile name. See Optimizer Hub Generic Defaults > Cross-Region Sync for configuration options. Database Changes Optimizer Hub 1.9 includes an update to the Code Cache database schema. After upgrading, Optimizer Hub dumps old Code Cache data and recreates it the next time you run your application. New Location of REST APIs and ReadyNow Profile Cleaner The REST APIs and ReadyNow Profile Cleaner moved to the new Management Gateway component, and the APIs are now exposed on a different address. The Management Gateway is disabled by default, see Management Gateway Parameters as this component is not required in all use-cases. Prioritization of Profile Generations ReadyNow Orchestrator allows you to set different minimum size and recording durations for different generations of your profiles. Often you want to promote the first generation of your profile as quickly as possible so new JVMs are not starting with nothing, but you want your second generation to record for a longer time before promotion, so it is more complete. New configuration settings: minProfileSize, minProfileDuration, minProfileSizePerGeneration, and minProfileDurationPerGeneration. Check ReadyNow Orchestrator Defaults for more info. Grafana Dashboard The Grafana Dashboard has been updated with more information for greater visibility into Optimizer Hub performance. Bug Fixes The message \"Error occurred while executing task for trigger IntervalTrigger\" may be seen during initialization. This resolves automatically after some time and works as expected. Optimizer Hub 1.8.2 Release Date: December 19, 2023 - Release Notes PDF New Features Fixes an issue in 1.8.1 where the cache component is not able to scale up. Fixes an issue that caused unexpected HTTP/1.x requests for GET /q/metrics to be reported in the logging. Optimizer Hub 1.8.1 Release Date: December 6, 2023 - Release Notes PDF New Features Includes bug fixes for Optimizer Hub 1.8.0. Known Issues The message \"Error occurred while executing task for trigger IntervalTrigger\" may be seen during initialization. This will resolve automatically after some time and work as expected. Optimizer Hub 1.8.0 Release Date: September 12, 2023 - Release Notes PDF As Cloud Native Compiler expands its scope to offer more functionality than just offloading compilations, it is time to rebrand the offering to better reflect what it does. Starting with release 1.8, we are using the following naming: Optimizer Hub (was Cloud Native Compiler) - The name of the overall component that you install on your Kubernetes cluster. Cloud Native Compiler (was Compiler Service) - The feature that performs the compilation on Optimizer Hub. ReadyNow Orchestrator (was Profile Log Service) - The feature that records and serves ReadyNow profiles to JVMs. In Optimizer Hub 1.8, all major artifacts and command line switches use the updated branding. This includes, but is not limited to: Command-line JVM options to configure Cloud Native Compiler and ReadyNow Orchestrator. Helm repository locations, names, and parameter names: github.com/AzulSystems/opthub-helm-charts. REST API URLs. If you are using release 1.7 and earlier, all of the previous spellings of artifacts still work. Additionally, all of the pre-1.8 command-line arguments will continue to work for a period of one year from the release of 1.8. New Features Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana is no longer included in the Optimizer Hub Helm charts, but must be configured separately as described on Monitoring Optimizer Hub. In the past, each release was bundled with the most likely JVM compiler engine. This is no longer the cause, resulting in smaller images. Session rebalancing has been improved with an (optional) Envoy proxy, or any other gRPC-aware load balancer/ingress in your Kubernetes cluster. More information can be found on Configuring gRPC Proxy. Documentation has been extended with installation instructions for Google Cloud. Known Issues Fixed Ports for gRPC The helm chart values contain the keys gateway.service.httpEndpoint.port and gateway.service.grpc.port to change the default ports 50051 and 8080. But these values are hardcoded for the gRPC Envoy proxy, at this moment, and cannot be changed with the mentioned helm chart keys. Cloud Native Compiler 1.7.1 Release Date: June 30, 2023 New Features Profile Log Service now stores profile metadata in the blob storage. This means that you can use AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage to persist profile metadata and no longer need to back up the database pod with persistent storage. This change also means that when you upgrade from any release prior to 1.7.1 your previously collected profiles are no longer available. Because of this change, the db component (MariaDB) is no longer needed when running CNC in Profile Log Service-only mode. Profile Log service automatically cleans-up unused profile names when not requested for a defined time. You can configure the duration with profileLogService.cleaner.keepUnrequestedProfileNamesFor. See Configuring ReadyNow Orchestrator for more configuration information. New version of the Grafana monitoring dashboard with additional charts, and updates related to changes in the metrics reported by CNC components. You can define the profile log name with a Java property specified in the command line, in the format %prop={PROPERTY}%. For more info, see \"Using the Profile Log Service > Substitution Macros\". Improved setup for Profile Log Service-only deployment. CNC can automatically recover from DB pod restarts with loss of schema. To enable this feature, set the following value in values-override.yaml:  dbschema.auto-recreate.enabled=true The hostPort attribute is no longer required and included for the storage pod. Cloud Native Compiler 1.7.0 Release Date: May 3, 2023 New Features Improved performance of autoscaling for the Compiler Service. Usability improvements to the Profile Log Service Admin REST API. Native blob storage on Azure and AWS. Extra documentation is provided on: Configuring AWS S3 Storage Configuring Azure Blob Storage Added documentation of the CNC API. Cloud Native Compiler 1.6.3 Release Date: May 24, 2023 New Feature Fix to prevent the storage pod from crashing with persistent volume enabled on CNC 1.6.2. Cloud Native Compiler 1.6.2 Release Date: April 27, 2023 New Features The CNC helm charts now use full names for the Docker images to prevent issues in environments where a Docker Hub mirror is used. CNC pods can now be run as non-root user. The Docker images have a non-root user and the Helm chart is instructing Kubernetes to use this non-root user for CNC pods. Upgrade Follow the steps described on \"Upgrading Cloud Native Compiler\". Cloud Native Compiler 1.6.1 Release Date: March 1, 2023 New Features To avoid restarts of the Gateway pod when a large number of clients try to write profile logs at the same time, a default limit has been configured. Upgrade from version 1.6.0 can be done with a helm upgrade, as described on Upgrading Cloud Native Compiler. Bug Fixes Gateway pod gets restarted when large number of clients try to write profile simultaneously. Known Issues JVMs released before CNC 1.6.1 use HTTP for uploads of the compiler engine. Since version 1.6.1, gRPC is used and the HTTP port is disabled by default in values.yaml. Because of this, these JVMs will not be able to upload their appropriate compiler engine to CNC. When a CNC version prior to 1.6.1 already has been used and upgraded, the older JVMs will keep working with CNC, because the upload is not needed anymore. The first attempt to download a previously existing profile, after CNC upgrade to 1.6.1 can fail with a timeout. Cloud Native Compiler 1.6.0 Release Date: January 30, 2023 New Features Cloud Native Compiler has a new Profile Log Service. This service allows you to read and write ReadyNow profile logs to Cloud Native Compiler. This simplifies getting profile logs in and out of containers and other environments without persistent storage. For more information on Profile Log Service configuration, see \"Using the Profile Log Service\". Introduced ReadyNow-only deployment to helm charts. Bug Fixes Multiple APIs failed with empty response. Cache requests latency increased manifold resulting in an increase in wait time and overall compilation duration. Known Issues In case of heavy applications, if you see anomalies in TTCOB, the problem can be resolved by increasing the number of cache pods. For more info, see \"Troubleshooting Cloud Native Compiler \". Cloud Native Compiler 1.5.0 Release Date: October 31, 2022 New Features Compiler Cache on by default. New Time to Clear Optimization Backlog metric in Grafana dashboard. Known Issues Multiple pods can get evicted because of low ephemeral storage in a long-running Code Cache cluster. Cloud Native Compiler 1.4.0 Release Date: July 8, 2022 New Features Early access of the Compiler Cache. The Compiler Cache stores previously performed optimizations and serves them from the cache rather than recompiling whenever possible. Running your workloads with a Compiler Cache leads to lower CNC CPU usage and faster warmup time. Known Issues Compiler Cache is not scalable and too many connections will overload the database. Multiple pods can get evicted because of low ephemeral storage in a long-running Code Cache cluster. Cloud Native Compiler 1.3.0 Release Date: May 9, 2022 New Features Simplified installation and configuration with Helm charts. Known Issues ZVM-23070 - Using Cloud Native Compiler with local ReadyNow can dramatically increase the CPU required to deliver the compilations in time. Monitor your compiler output and look for connections being rejected and the JVM switching to local compilation, and scale out your CNC instance accordingly. Cloud Native Compiler 1.2.0 Release Date: February 24, 2021 New Features Fallback to local JIT compilation when Cloud Native Compiler is unreachable or underperforming. You can now provide an existing ReadyNow profile as the input of the -XX:ProfileLogIn={file} flag. Note that generating a ReadyNow profile using the -XX:ProfileLogOut={file} is not supported with Cloud Native Compiler yet. Cloud Native Compiler 1.1.0 Release Date: December 20, 2021 New Features Built-in monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana. JDK 17 support. Known Issues The CNC gateway is currently configured with one instance. Do not attempt to increase the number of gateway instances. Extremely slow disk I/o configurations (with latencies in the multiple seconds) can lead to internal crashes and data loss within CNC (due to Artemis crashes). Avoid configuring CNC with pods using very slow HDD or network volumes. Cloud Native Compiler 1.0.0 Release Date: October 15, 2021 This is the first release of Cloud Connected Compiler (CNC), and we are really excited about it! New Features Cloud Native Compiler server able to provide JIT compilations to Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK 12.09.1.0 and later. Configuration files to provision an AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service cluster for your CNC server. A sample Grafana dashboard for monitoring your CNC server."

  "content" : "Optimizer Hub 1.8.0 Release Date: September 12, 2023 - Release Notes PDF As Cloud Native Compiler expands its scope to offer more functionality than just offloading compilations, it is time to rebrand the offering to better reflect what it does. Starting with release 1.8, we are using the following naming: Optimizer Hub (was Cloud Native Compiler) - The name of the overall component that you install on your Kubernetes cluster. Cloud Native Compiler (was Compiler Service) - The feature that performs the compilation on Optimizer Hub. ReadyNow Orchestrator (was Profile Log Service) - The feature that records and serves ReadyNow profiles to JVMs. In Optimizer Hub 1.8, all major artifacts and command line switches use the updated branding. This includes, but is not limited to: Command-line JVM options to configure Cloud Native Compiler and ReadyNow Orchestrator. Helm repository locations, names, and parameter names: github.com/AzulSystems/opthub-helm-charts. REST API URLs. If you are using release 1.7 and earlier, all of the previous spellings of artifacts still work. Additionally, all of the pre-1.8 command-line arguments will continue to work for a period of one year from the release of 1.8. New Features Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana is no longer included in the Optimizer Hub Helm charts, but must be configured separately as described on Monitoring Optimizer Hub. In the past, each release was bundled with the most likely JVM compiler engine. This is no longer the cause, resulting in smaller images. Session rebalancing has been improved with an (optional) Envoy proxy, or any other gRPC-aware load balancer/ingress in your Kubernetes cluster. More information can be found on Configuring gRPC Proxy. Documentation has been extended with installation instructions for Google Cloud. Known Issues Fixed Ports for gRPC The helm chart values contain the keys gateway.service.httpEndpoint.port and gateway.service.grpc.port to change the default ports 50051 and 8080. But these values are hardcoded for the gRPC Envoy proxy, at this moment, and cannot be changed with the mentioned helm chart keys."

  "content" : "Installing Optimizer Hub These instructions are for installing a full Optimizer Hub instance with both Cloud Native Compiler and ReadyNow Orchestrator. In case you only want to install the full Optimizer Hub, but only a part of the services, see \"Configuring the Active Optimizer Hub Services\". Install Azul Zulu Prime Builds of OpenJDK 21.09.1.0 or newer on your client machine. Make sure your Helm version is v3.8.0 or newer. Add the Azul Helm repository to your Helm environment:  helm repo add opthub-helm https://azulsystems.github.io/opthub-helm-charts/\nhelm repo update Create a namespace (i.e. my-opthub) for Optimizer Hub.  kubectl create namespace my-opthub Create the values-override.yaml file in your local directory. If you have a custom cluster domain name, specify it in values-override.yaml:  clusterName: \"example.org\" Configure sizing and autoscaling of the Optimizer Hub components according to the sizing guide. By default, autoscaling is on and Optimizer Hub can scale up to 10 Compile Brokers. For example, you could set the following:  simpleSizing:\n  vCores: 32\n  minVCores: 32\n  maxVCores: 106 If needed, configure external access in your cluster. If your JVMs are running within the same cluster as Optimizer Hub, you can ignore this step. Otherwise, it is necessary to configure an external load balancer in values-override.yaml. For clusters running on AWS an example configuration file is available on Azul’s GitHub. Install using Helm, passing in the values-override.yaml.  helm install opthub opthub-helm/azul-opthub -n my-opthub -f values-override.yaml In case you need a specific Optimizer Hub version, please use --version 1.9.0 flag. The command should produce output similar to this:  NAME: opthub\nLAST DEPLOYED: Wed Jan 31 12:19:58 2024\nNAMESPACE: my-opthub\nSTATUS: deployed\nREVISION: 1\nTEST SUITE: None Verify that all started pods are ready:  kubectl get all -n my-opthub"

  "url" : "https://docs.azul.com/optimizer-hub/installation/kubernetes",
  "link" : "https://docs.azul.com/optimizer-hub/installation/kubernetes#configuring-persistent-storage",
  "content" : "Configuring Persistent Storage By default, Optimizer Hub pods allocate data directories on the root disk or in an emptyDir volume, both residing in the pod’s ephemeral storage. If the pod dies, all data is lost and has to be regenerated after restart. When you move the pods' data directories to persistent volumes, the data survives pod crashes, restarts and even scale down/up events. Furthermore, this allows you to lower the local storage sizing of target Kubernetes worker nodes, since large data directories will be stored in separate volumes outside of these worker nodes. When you use persistent volumes, you create 2 additional Kubernetes objects per pod: persistentVolumeClaim (PVC), whose name is derived from parent pod persistentVolume (PV), which is allocated automatically by chosen the storage class and has an auto-generated name. PV and PVC objects lifecycles are separate from other Optimizer Hub Kubernetes objects. When you uninstall Optimizer Hub using the helm chart, these objects remain in cluster for as long as the installation namespace exists. Removal of namespace or manual deletion of PVCs within the namespace automatically removes their associated PVs from the Kubernetes cluster as well. You can configure persistent volumes for the db and builtinStorage components. The configuration is the same for both components. Your target Kubernetes cluster needs to have at least one storage class configured. By default, Optimizer Hub uses the default configured storage class. Note If you are using AWS EBS Storage for your persistent storage, use gp3 volumes instead of gp2 volumes. gp2 volumes have have limited IOPS which can affect Optimizer Hub performance. Additional configuration info for AWS S3 Storage is available here. Note If you are using Azure Blob Storage, please check \"Installing Optimizer Hub on Azure\" for additional settings. Configuration with Custom Resources Values Example pod sizing with 10GiB for root volume and 100GiB for data volume:  db:\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      cpu: \"5\"\n      memory: \"20Gi\"\n      ephemeral-storage: \"10Gi\"\n    limits:\n      cpu: \"5\"\n      memory: \"20Gi\"\n      ephemeral-storage: \"10Gi\"\n  persistentDataVolume:\n    enabled: true\n    size: \"100Gi\" If you want to use recommended sizing of pods, you still need to explicitly override the default size of the ephemeral storage. This is in order to not waste resources and increase pod schedulability on smaller sized nodes.  db:\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      ephemeral-storage: \"10Gi\"\n    limits:\n      ephemeral-storage: \"10Gi\"\n  persistentDataVolume:\n    enabled: true\n    size: \"100Gi\" Configuration with Custom Storage Class If your cluster has multiple configured storage classes, and you want to use a non-default storage class, do the following:  db:\n  resources:\n  persistentDataVolume:\n    enabled: true\n    storageClassName: \"my-storage-class\""

An example file is available on GitHub in the Azul \"opthub-helm-charts\" project, to disable all resource definitions. As the supplied values file for minikube resets pod resources to null, we can simply add only the persistent volume section:  db:\n  resources:\n  persistentDataVolume:\n    enabled: true You can also set the volume size if the default 200Gi is too big for local testing:  db:\n  resources:\n  persistentDataVolume:\n    enabled: true\n    size: \"50Gi\" Install using Helm, passing in the values-minikube.yaml. In case you don’t want to install the full Optimizer Hub, but only a part of the services, first check \"Configuring the Active Optimizer Hub Services\".  helm install opthub opthub-helm/azul-opthub -n my-opthub -f values-minikube.yaml The command should produce output similar to this:  NAME: opthub\nLAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jan 30 14:35:29 2023\nNAMESPACE: my-opthub\nSTATUS: deployed\nREVISION: 1\nTEST SUITE: None Verify that all started pods are ready:  minikube kubectl -- get all -n my-opthub"

These compiler engines are not shipped with Cloud Native Compiler. When attempting to use Cloud Native Compiler for compilation, the JVM checks if the right compiler engine is present and, if not, automatically uploads it to Cloud Native Compiler. If your Optimizer Hub instance is using default 8080 HTML ports, or you are fronting it with a load balancer, then there is nothing the user needs to do to configure uploads correctly. If you are connecting without a loadbalancer and are not using the default 8080 ports, follow the process described above to provide the JVM user with the host and port mapped to 8080. The JVM user must specify this host/port in the -XX:CNCEngineUploadAddress=host:port. In the above example, the host/port combination is 10.22.20.131:30926."

  "content" : "While you can use Optimizer Hub without SSL authentication for development and evaluation, it is highly recommended that you run your production Optimizer Hub with SSL authentication. To enable SSL authentication on your Optimizer Hub: Establish your SSL certificate. In order to enable SSL encryption of the communication between the JVM and Optimizer Hub, you will need to provide a certificate and a corresponding private key in the pem format. Note The common name field in the certificate must match the name of the Optimizer Hub service as provided to client JVMs via the —XX:OptHubHost flag. Otherwise there may be issues when connecting. Enable SSL in your values-overrride.yaml file:  ssl:\n  enabled: true Add your certificate and private key. This can be done in several ways: The most secure way to add certificates is using a separate chain that manages your certificate. You can then point the deployment to a custom secret in the installation namespace. Such a secret needs to have keys named cert.pem and key.pem.  ssl:\n  secretName: \"my-custom-secret\" You can add the certificate and private keys directly to the values.yaml as values. This is the simplest way to run quick experiments in a controlled environment, especially when you’re installing from the Helm repository. We do not recommend this approach in production as it embeds private security credentials in a config file:  ssl:\n  value:\n    cert: |-\n      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n      ...\n      -----END CERTIFICATE-----\n    key: |-\n      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n      ...\n      -----END PRIVATE KEY----- If you downloaded and unpacked the Helm chart to a local directory, you can just place files named cert.pem and key.pem into the root directory of your Helm chart. Perform Helm installation as shown in the general installation guide."

To connect to Optimizer Hub using SSL, make sure the service certificate is trusted by the client server where you run Azul Zulu Prime JDK. This can be achieved by having the certificate signed by a publicly trusted certificate authority. If you have an internal CA trusted within the company infrastructure, make sure it is trusted. The exact process depends on your OS distribution. Follow the instructions for your OS distribution to register the certificate on your client server. For example, on Ubuntu-based distributions you run the following command:  sudo openssl x509 -in {path to cert.pem} -inform PEM -out /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cert.crt\nsudo update-ca-certificates Alternatively, you can explicitly instruct Azul Zulu Prime JDK to use and trust a specified certificate on the filesystem by using the -XX:OptHubSSLRootsPath={path to cert.pem} flag. If certificate validation fails, your .pem file is missing or does not match the certificate that you uploaded to Optimizer Hub, you get the following error:  [1.856s][info][concomp] [gRPCEvent] read error!\n[1.856s][info][concomp] [gRPC processing] BidiStreamWrapper is dying, finishing stream 0x7fbec00180f0 with status: failed to connect to all addresses (14)"

When the data size in your storage exceeds a threshold, ReadyNow Orchestrator deletes old profile logs, thus guaranteeing that a promoted profile log is available for all profile names. The Management Gateway is required, in order for cleanup to be enabled, see Management Gateway Parameters. You can also configure ReadyNow Orchestrator to delete unused profile names completely after a given duration using the readyNowOrchestrator.cleaner.keepUnrequestedProfileNamesFor property in your values-override.yaml. For example, to keep unused profiles for 5 days, use the following:  readyNowOrchestrator.cleaner.keepUnrequestedProfileNamesFor=P5D ReadyNow Orchestrator triggers cleanup when you have used around 60% of the available space in your storage. If you are using a persistent volume to back up your storage, ReadyNow Orchestrator calculates the threshold for triggering clean up automatically. If you are using S3 or Azure Blob Storage, there is no reliable way for ReadyNow Orchestrator to calculate the size of the blob storage. You must therefore specify the size using the readyNowOrchestrator.cleaner.externalPersistentStorageSoftLimit property, which by default, is 10Gb. Note that depending on your usage, ReadyNow Orchestrator’s clean-up mechanism may not be able to keep the actual size of your stored profiles below the size of your storage. When you reach 90% usage, a warning is printed in the log of the gateway service. If your storage fills up completely, JVMs attempting to write to ReadyNow Orchestrator receive an error."

  "content" : "Scaling Overview Scaling Optimizer Hub is controlled by how much capacity Optimizer Hub has to process compilation requests. This is controlled by the amount of vCores Optimizer Hub has been provisioned. Note that scaling is primarily a concern when discussing Cloud Native Compiler. ReadyNow Orchestrator consumes much fewer resources than Cloud Native Compiler and will often never need to scale beyond its minimum installation. A critical metric to measure whether your Cloud Native Compiler is responding to compilation requests in time is the Time to Clear Optimization Backlog (TCOB). When you start a Java program, there is a burst of compilation activity as a large amount of optimization requests are put on the compilation queue. Eventually, the compiler catches up with the optimization backlog and all new compilation requests are started within 2 seconds of being put on the compilation queue. The TCOB is the measurement, for each individual JVM, of how long it took from the start of the compilation activity to when the optimization backlog is cleared. To find the right amount of vCores to provision for a job, first determine an acceptable TCOB for your application. Different applications will find different TCOBs acceptable depending on how many optimizations the program requests and how quickly you need to warm it up. As a starting point, set the amount of time you want to wait before the application is ready to accept requests as your target TCOB. Perform a test run of a single JVM against your Cloud Native Compiler. In Grafana, check the Time to Clear Optimization Backlog and Compilations in Progress graphs. If the maximum TCOB during your application’s warmup is lower than your target, you can scale down the number of vCores provisioned for the job. If the maximum TCOB is higher than your target, check the Compilations in Progress metric in Grafana. This metric shows you actual compilations in progress versus Cloud Native Compiler capacity. If you are using the full capacity, add more vCores to the capacity. You should also check the client JVM logs to see whether the JVM fell back to using local compilation. JVMs switch to local compilation when Cloud Native Compiler becomes unresponsive or tells the JVM that it cannot handle any new requests. You can also see the number of local fallbacks in the Grafana dashboard."

  "content" : "Creating and Writing To a New Profile Name You use ReadyNow Orchestrator by creating a connection to the Optimizer Hub and specifying the criteria for reading and writing profile logs. All of the necessary options can be specified as command-line arguments to the Java process at the time of deployment. The basic lifecycle of using ReadyNow profile logs is as follows: The JVM streams profile log output to ReadyNow Orchestrator, giving the output a unique profile name. Based on basic criteria specified in the command-line arguments, the JVM nominates the output profile log as a candidate for sharing with other JVMs. ReadyNow Orchestrator deals with candidate profile logs arriving from various JVMs that use the same profile name. Whenever the service receives a request for a profile log with a given profile name, it examines the candidates it has collected and serves up the best one. This can change over time as ReadyNow Orchestrator receives new and more complete profile log candidates. JVMs can request multiple generations of a profile log. Rather than starting with no input profile log and recording its output log based on the regular JIT profiling process, the JVM can take a profile log as the input and further refine the profiling information, recording its experience as a new generation of that profile log. If you need to minimize the chances of having any deoptimizations through the life of your Java program, it is sometimes beneficial to record several generations. ReadyNow Orchestrator always serves the newest generation for a profile name to JVMs. JVMs can cap the number of generations that they write out to avoid developing the profile forever."

The default is localhost:50051. See Connecting a JVM to Optimizer Hub for how instructions on determining the correct host and port. null -XX:ProfileLogName={profilePath} Name of the profile that the JVM both reads from and writes to. Use of this flag is equivalent to using -XX:ProfileLogIn={profilePath} -XX:ProfileLogOut={profilePath}, and is the preferred way to specify profile names when different input and output names are not needed. If prefixed with opthub://, {profilePath} is used as the profile name in ReadyNow Orchestrator. If not prefixed with opthub://, {profilePath} is interpreted as a file path on the JVM. null -XX:ProfileLogOut={profilePath} The ProfileLogOut enables Azul Zulu Prime JVM to record compilations from the current run. {profilePath} is the name of the profile that the JVM reads as input to ReadyNow. If prefixed with opthub://, {profilePath} is used as the profile name in ReadyNow Orchestrator. If not prefixed with opthub://, {profilePath} is interpreted as a file path on the JVM. null -XX:ProfileLogIn={profilePath} The ProfileLogIn allows Azul Zulu Prime JVM to base its decisions on the information from a previous run. The current ProfileLogIn file information will be read in its entirety - before Azul Zulu Prime JVM starts to create a new ProfileLogOut log. {profilePath} is the name of the profile that the JVM reads as input to ReadyNow. If prefixed with opthub://, {profilePath} is used as the profile name in ReadyNow Orchestrator. If not prefixed with opthub://, {profilePath} is interpreted as a file path on the JVM. null -XX:ProfileLogOutNominationMinSize Indicate to server that the produced profile is eligible for promotion after specified amount of bytes recorded. 0 = any size eligible -1 = will never be promoted 1M -XX:ProfileLogOutNominationMinSizePerGeneration Define minimum acceptable amount of bytes per generation which the profile size should reach to become eligible for promotion. null -XX:ProfileLogOutNominationMinTimeSec When used with ReadyNow Orchestrator, the minimum time, in seconds, a profile must record before ReadyNow Orchestrator will nominate it as a candidate. 0 = any duration eligible -1 = will never be promoted 120 -XX:ProfileLogOutNominationMinTimeSecPerGeneration When used with ReadyNow Orchestrator, the minimum time, in seconds, per generation during which the profile should be recorded in order to become eligible for promotion. null -XX:ProfileLogOutMaxNominatedGenerationCount When used with ReadyNow Orchestrator, specifies the maximum generation of a profile that a VM will nominate. This JVM command line parameter overrides the serverside default to configure ReadyNow Orchestrator. 0 = unlimited 0 -XX:ProfileLogMaxSize={value in bytes} Specifies the maximum size that a ReadyNow profile log is allowed to reach. Profiles will be truncated at this size, regardless of whether the application has actually been completely warmed up. This JVM command line parameter overrides the serverside default to configure ReadyNow Orchestrator. It is recommended to either not set this size explicitly, or set it generously if required, for example: -XX:ProfileLogMaxSize=1G 0 = unlimited 0 -XX:ProfileLogTimeLimitSeconds={value in seconds} Instructs ReadyNow to stop adding to the profile log after a period of N seconds regardless of where the application has been completely warmed up. It is recommended to either not set this size explicitly, or set it generously if required. 0 = unlimited 0 -XX:ProfileLogDumpInputToFile={name} Dumps input profile to the specified path. For debugging purposes only. null -XX:ProfileLogDumpOutputToFile={name} Dumps output profile to the specified path. For debugging purposes only. null -XX:RNOConnectionTimeoutMillis Timeout on establishing remote connection and timeout on interval between downloading two chunks. Specified in milliseconds. 5000 -XX:RNOProfileFallbackInput Experimental feature. Local filesystem path which gets used in case no profile data is downloaded. E.g., in case of a missing connection or the requested profile name doesn’t exist on the server. null -XX:ProfileLogOutVerbose Enables logging of verbose, optional tracing information in -XX:ProfileLogOut true Substitution Macros The profile name is the central organizing attribute that ReadyNow Orchestrator uses to group together profile logs. ReadyNow Orchestrator regards all candidates it receives that contain the same profile name as being for the same application, with no further knowledge of what code was actually runs. This poses the danger of accidentally using the same profile name for two different applications. For example, if a user copies and pastes the command-line arguments, including the profile name, from a production application and uses it to run HelloWorld, the HelloWorld profile could, in some cases, replace your valid production application profile. To avoid this danger, you can use substitution macros in your profile name to limit the likelihood of profile name clashes between different applications. Each macro unfolds to a 4-byte hash string taken from a particular plain-text string corresponding to a property: Macro Description %classpathhash Hashed user-defined Java class path string %vmargshash Hashed JVM arguments string %vmflagshash Hashed JVM flags string %cmdlinehash Hashed string containing all plain-text values from above macros. Input values are concatenated to one string: Java class path string + JVM arguments string + JVM flags string. Afterwards, 4-bytes hash is applied to concatenated result. %jdkver Hashed JDK version number converted to string %jvmver Hashed JVM version number converted to string %prop={PROPERTY}% Substition macro defining the profile log name.

  "content" : "Basic Profile Recording with Defaults In its most basic form, you just let the defaults do all the work. By default, ReadyNow Orchestrator will nominate profile logs after three full generations and does not place a limit on log size. Suppose you want to record a new profile while deploying code to a fleet running in production. Run with the following options:  java -XX:OptHubHost=TestEnvOptHubHost \\\n    -XX:ProfileLogName=opthub://MyApp-v3 \\\n    -jar myapp.jar In this case, all JVMs nominate their logs based on the defaults (e.g. 2 minutes for the first generation, 15 minutes for the second generation, etc.) and keep recording until the JVM shuts down. For best results, do a test run in a canary instance for at least two minutes and if possible a full ten minutes. This creates generation 1 of your profile. Then restart your fleet as normal. As JVMs start up, they receive a profile from ReadyNow Orchestrator and check the generation number. If that number is less than the server-side default maximum of 3, the JVM writes out the next generation of the profile. Once there is a valid generation 3 of the profile on ReadyNow Orchestrator, none of the JVMs write any more output."

Ensure that VM is started with -XX:OptHubHost= parameter pointing to the address of the Optimizer Hub gateway. See Connecting a JVM to a Cloud Native Compiler for more details on Optimizer Hub-related VM parameters and Installing Optimizer Hub for finding out the gateway address. Enable Optimizer Hub logging in VM using -Xlog:concomp parameter and look for log messages that show the JVM connecting to and disconnecting from Optimizer Hub. If the log says that the VM fails to connect to the service, check that the service is up and running, check the network connectivity between JVM and service, and check the value of -XX:OptHubHost=. If the log says that VM disconnects from the service soon after connecting, the log should also give the reason for disconnecting. The most frequent reason for such disconnects is a missing Compiler Engine on the service, indicated by the FAILED_PRECONDITION error code and message Compiler engine … not found. See Registering a New Compiler Engine for more information. If the connection between the VM and service is established and does not break, then proceed to item #3. Collect VM GC log, open it in GCLA and see top-tier compilation statistics. Top-tier compilation stats can also be seen in VM compilation log (-XX:+PrintCompilation). If stats show high top-tier compilation failure ratio, then it’s time to troubleshoot Cloud Native Compiler. Write down the VM ID seen in the VM concomp log, it can be used to filter service events related to this particular VM. You can find the VM ID in connected-compiler-%p.log:  # Log command-line option\n-Xlog:concomp=info:file=connected-compiler-%p.log::filesize=500M:filecount=20\n\n# Example:\n[0.647s][info ][concomp] [ConnectedCompiler] received new VM-Id: 4f762530-8389-4ae9-b64a-69b1adacccf2 Proceed to Cloud Native Compiler Server Troubleshooting. Use the TTCOB metric to research possible problems. An overloaded client (the JVM) can cause worse performance of Cloud Native Compiler. This could be seen as a too high TTCOB metric. One example of such overload is CPU saturation on JVM side. This can cause smaller amounts of compilations being sent to Cloud Native Compiler but also a worse performance of Cloud Native Compiler compilation because an overloaded JVM affects the communication between the CNC Compiler and JVM itself. If TTCOB is over the threshold: Look at the \"Compilations in progress\" chart. If \"Compilations\" value hits the capacity, then the server is the bottleneck and should be scaled. Otherwise the bottleneck is related to the per-VM limit on concurrent compilations. It should be increased. Scaling server without increasing that per-VM limit won’t help. If TTCOB is below threshold: How much below threshold is it? If there is a gap between the actual TTCOB and the threshold, then Optimizer Hub can be downscaled proportionally to the gap. Otherwise relax and don’t touch anything. If scaling compile-brokers doesn’t improve TTCOB, the culprit may be the cache. A typical symptom is cache CPU usage hitting the ceiling, depending on the workload. An example can be seen in this graph: If that’s the case, one can modify simple sizing relationships to have more caches. This is the relevant section in the values.yaml:  simpleSizing:\n  relationships:\n    brokersPerGateway: 30\n    brokersPerCache: 20 Settings brokersPerCache to a lower value (e.g. 15) will result in having more cache instances relative to compile-brokers. I see occasional \"compiler timeout\" errors in service logs and/or grafana dashboard. What’s that? Every compilation on Cloud Native Compiler has a time limit. By default it’s 500 seconds. If that limit is exceeded, the first thing to check is network latency between VM and Cloud Native Compiler using ping {opthub_host}. Latency should not exceed single-digit milliseconds. If the latency is higher, CNC won’t deliver its best performance. Make sure to locate VMs close enough to CNC. You can use the \"VM rountrip\" widget in the Grafana dashboard to detect if this limit is exceeded. In rare cases there are very large compilations that actually require that long. If that’s the case, compilation timeout can be changed by adding -Dcompiler.timeout={N} flag to compile-broker, where {N} is the number in seconds. My application running in a Optimizer Hub-enabled VM behaves incorrectly or crashes. What can I do? Collect all VM logs and the hs_err* file and send it to Azul for analysis. Run the application without the -XX:OptHubHost flag to verify that the problem is specific to connecting to Optimizer Hub. I sometimes see entries about failed compilations because of \"ConnectedCompiler is not yet ready\", but I see it is compiling fine. Is that ok? This may happen when running with SSL enabled. The VM keeps an open connection to the service, but sometimes the connection can be reset or re-established. It may happen that the VM tries to send a compilation request in the very moment. With SSL, the VM and the service need to do a handshake to make sure the connection is trusted. It is very quick, but it is possible the VM hits this small window. It is harmless as the compilation is resubmitted the next moment."

  "content" : "Cloud Native Compiler Troubleshooting JVM compilation log shows that top-tier compilations are started, but never finished. What can I do? This can be caused by one of these reasons: No compile-broker pods are running in the Optimizer Hub cluster. Make sure that at least one compile-broker is up and running. Cloud Native Compiler has too many compilation requests enqueued due to too many VMs connected and it takes too long to provide compiled code. To confirm, check the \"Compilation Queues\" chart in Grafana. Increase the number of compile-broker replicas. I see occasional \"vm unreachable\" in service logs and/or grafana dashboard. What’s that? This is caused by the service’s inability to receive some information necessary for the compilation from the JVM. It usually happens when the JVM disconnects from the service for any reason, e.g. JVM termination or a network error. It’s harmless. The service just skips the compilation and proceeds to the next one."

  "content" : "Vulnerability Detection is a production-speed software composition analyzer. By using the JVM to retain information about loaded code, Azul Vulnerability Detection can apply analysis to look back and see where new vulnerabilities are used and/or present. When Java applications launch with vulnerability detection, the JVM operates at full speed with an asycnchronous collector that communicates with Azul Vulnerability Detection. This data can later detect standard JAR files, shaded JARs, flattened JARs, and other packaging types. By working in the JVM itself, the collector operates at peak speed and does not rely on instrumentation — this independence can collect data from applications where jlink removed the java.instrument module. CVE Detection reports are available: Via the web user interface. Via the API."

  "content" : "About the Forwarder The Forwarder is a central point of communication for an organization’s JVMs to reach Azul Vulnerability Detection. By moving requests through a Forwarder, organizations can maintain fewer firewall rules for outbound communication, improve the speed of JVMs through local communication and caching, and maintain application control. Your organization must configure one or more of these Forwarders to receive data in Azul Vulnerability Detection, based on a mix of network and organizational structure requirements. The primary role of a Forwarder is to act as an intelligent proxy so that many JVMs can connect to Azul Vulnerability Detection without any JVM being directly connected to the internet. Communication Patterns Each JRE on a network communicates to the Forwarder, which communicates to Azul Vulnerability Detection. The Forwarder cannot initiate communication with a JRE and can only respond. Failure Resiliency Communication between a JVM and the Forwarder is fault-tolerant. A JVM will always continue to operate its workload regardless of its ability to communicate with the Forwarder. If the network is unreliable, or connection difficulties occur between a JVM and the Forwarder, the JVM will attempt to reconnect. If reconnection succeeds, data loss between the time of disconnection and time of reconnection may occur."

Server Requirements The Forwarder can run on any server within your environment at a location where it can be reached by many JVMs and the Forwarder itself can reach Azul Vulnerability Detection. The only requirement is a Java runtime, version 8 or newer. Downloading the Forwarder The Forwarder application can be downloaded from the Azul repository:  curl -O https://cdn.azul.com/forwarder/1.0.5/forwarder.jar Configuring the Forwarder Three different possibilities are supported to configure the Forwarder, and the values defined in each of them have this priority: System variables Properties file Environment variables Some settings are the ones filled in or retrieved from the Web UI earlier, others are related to the created certificate. The settings will be used by the Forwarder to connect to Azul Vulnerability Detection. Once authenticated, the Forwarder will exchange this information with Azul Vulnerability Detection to receive cryptographic certificates that will be trusted by the JVM. This is an overview of the available configuration options: Environment System Properties IC_HOST icHost ic.host The host of Azul Vulnerability Detection, copied from the Web UI Forwarder setup screen. CLOUD_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE cloudConnectionPoolSize cloud.connection.poolSize Connection pool size used to manage connections between the Forwarder and Azul Vulnerability Detection. The default value is 50. Example:  export CLOUD_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=100 FORWARDER_ACCESS_KEY forwarderAccessKey forwarder.access.key The Forwarder Access Key copied in the Azul Vulnerability Detection Web UI after adding the Forwarder. This Access Key will be used for authentication to Azul Vulnerability Detection. FORWARDER_DOMAIN_NAMES forwarderDomainNames forwarder.domain.names A comma-delimited list with he Forwarder Domain Names (all or subset of them) that were used to create the Forwarder in the Azul Vulnerability Detection Web UI. These Domain Names will be used as SN/SAN attributes when creating the certificates for the authorization phase between the Forwarder and Azul Vulnerability Detection. This list can contain IP addresses, but must contain at least one domain name. FORWARDER_KEYSTORE_PATH forwarderKeystorePath forwarder.keystore.path If no JKS file is found in the specified path, an empty keystore with the same name will be created. This keystore is used to store the auto-generated Forwarder certificates. FORWARDER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD forwarderKeystorePassword forwarder.keystore.password FORWARDER_PORT forwarderPort forwarder.port The Forwarder will listen on this port for incoming connections from VMs. The default value is 443. FORWARDER_STATE_REPORT_PATH forwarderStateReportPath forwarder.state.reportPath File path used by the Forwarder to periodically store its state. Example:  export FORWARDER_STATE_REPORT_PATH=./forwarder-state.log FORWARDER_STATE_CHECK_PERIOD forwarderStateCheckPeriod forwarder.state.checkPeriod Human-readable period specifying how often the state of the Forwarder should be checked and stored in the report path. It can be defined in the following formats: {N}d {N}h {N}min {N}sec {N}ms Example:  export FORWARDER_STATE_CHECK_PERIOD=10sec LOG_LEVEL logLevel log.level The default log level is INFO. By default, when errors are caught in the Forwarder, only error messages will be logged, without a stack trace. If you need to see the stack trace for debugging or troubleshooting purposes, use the TRACE level. Possible values (case-insensitive): ALL TRACE DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR OFF Note If you are concerned about the security of the password (FORWARDER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD) and/or key (FORWARDER_ACCESS_KEY) values, using environment variables is the recommended approach. Using Properties File When you want to use a properties-file to configure the Forwarder, follow these steps. Create a new file forwarder-settings.properties  touch forwarder-settings.properties Edit the file and add the following content, specifying all the required values as defined in the table above.  ic.host = ${intelligence-cloud-api-host}\nforwarder.access.key = ${forwarder-access-key}\nforwarder.domain.names = <domain-names-from-web-ui>\nforwarder.keystore.path = <path-to-keystore>/forwarder.jks\nforwarder.keystore.password = <desired keystore password>\nforwarder.port = 443 Start the Forwarder Application Start the Forwarder application with the following command:  $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -DforwarderSettings=forwarder-settings.properties -jar forwarder.jar Checking the State of the Forwarder Unsuccessful Start If either the Forwarder Access Key or Common Name does not match, the Forwarder will display an appropriate error message and fail to start. Keep an eye on the output of the Forwarder to check if it could start successfully. These are some possible error messages while connecting:  Failed to init certificate challenge: responseCode=403, responseContent={\"message\":\"Forbidden\"}\nFailed to authorize forwarder, the application will be stopped. Successful Start A successful startup will contain these info messages:  Forwarder certificate signed by IC issued successfully\nStart forwarding *:443 to YOUR_AVD_HOST:443 Status Screen Also after a successful startup, a status page is available at the address https://{FORWARDER_ENDPOINT}. Status API The health of the Forwarder can also be checked via an API on https://{FORWARDER_ENDPOINT}/forwarder/health, which will return, for example:  {\n  \"version\":\"1.0.5\",\n  \"state\":\"GREEN\",\n  \"uptime\":\"327454123\",\n  \"formattedUptime\":\"03d 18h 57m 34s\"\n} Or more extended data can be retrieved by adding ?extended=true like this https://{FORWARDER_ENDPOINT}/forwarder/health?extended=true, resulting in, for example:  {\n  \"state\": \"RED\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.5\",\n  \"uptime\": \"100610966\",\n  \"formattedUptime\": \"01d 03h 56m 50s\",\n  \"reasons\": [\n    \"CPU usage exceeded the RED threshold: usage=86%, threshold=85%\",\n    \"Heap memory usage (70%) has exceeded 65%\"\n  ],\n  \"memory\": {\n    \"heap.max\": \"10485760\",\n    \"heap.used\": \"7361768\",\n    \"heap.committed\": \"10485760\",\n    \"heap.init\": \"10485760\",\n    \"nonHeap.max\": \"-1\",\n    \"nonHeap.used\": \"28254384\",\n    \"nonHeap.committed\": \"31522816\",\n    \"nonHeap.init\": \"7667712\"\n  },\n  \"cpu\": {\n    \"jvmCpuUsage\": \"86%\",\n    \"systemCpuUsage\": \"97%\"\n  }\n} Forwarder State The state of the Forwarder is shown in both the Status-page and the API as GREEN in normal state or one of the following: Metrics Details Threshold State OperatingSystemMXBean#ProcessCpuLoad \"recent cpu usage\" for the Java Virtual Machine process 50% YELLOW OperatingSystemMXBean#ProcessCpuLoad \"recent cpu usage\" for the Java Virtual Machine process 85% RED MemoryMXBean#HeapMemoryUsage [amount of used memory in bytes] / [maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management] 65% YELLOW MemoryMXBean#HeapMemoryUsage [amount of used memory in bytes] / [maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management] 90% RED"

  "content" : "Configuring the Forwarder Three different possibilities are supported to configure the Forwarder, and the values defined in each of them have this priority: System variables Properties file Environment variables Some settings are the ones filled in or retrieved from the Web UI earlier, others are related to the created certificate. The settings will be used by the Forwarder to connect to Azul Vulnerability Detection. Once authenticated, the Forwarder will exchange this information with Azul Vulnerability Detection to receive cryptographic certificates that will be trusted by the JVM. This is an overview of the available configuration options: Environment System Properties IC_HOST icHost ic.host The host of Azul Vulnerability Detection, copied from the Web UI Forwarder setup screen. CLOUD_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE cloudConnectionPoolSize cloud.connection.poolSize Connection pool size used to manage connections between the Forwarder and Azul Vulnerability Detection. The default value is 50. Example:  export CLOUD_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE=100 FORWARDER_ACCESS_KEY forwarderAccessKey forwarder.access.key The Forwarder Access Key copied in the Azul Vulnerability Detection Web UI after adding the Forwarder. This Access Key will be used for authentication to Azul Vulnerability Detection. FORWARDER_DOMAIN_NAMES forwarderDomainNames forwarder.domain.names A comma-delimited list with he Forwarder Domain Names (all or subset of them) that were used to create the Forwarder in the Azul Vulnerability Detection Web UI. These Domain Names will be used as SN/SAN attributes when creating the certificates for the authorization phase between the Forwarder and Azul Vulnerability Detection. This list can contain IP addresses, but must contain at least one domain name. FORWARDER_KEYSTORE_PATH forwarderKeystorePath forwarder.keystore.path If no JKS file is found in the specified path, an empty keystore with the same name will be created. This keystore is used to store the auto-generated Forwarder certificates. FORWARDER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD forwarderKeystorePassword forwarder.keystore.password FORWARDER_PORT forwarderPort forwarder.port The Forwarder will listen on this port for incoming connections from VMs. The default value is 443. FORWARDER_STATE_REPORT_PATH forwarderStateReportPath forwarder.state.reportPath File path used by the Forwarder to periodically store its state. Example:  export FORWARDER_STATE_REPORT_PATH=./forwarder-state.log FORWARDER_STATE_CHECK_PERIOD forwarderStateCheckPeriod forwarder.state.checkPeriod Human-readable period specifying how often the state of the Forwarder should be checked and stored in the report path. It can be defined in the following formats: {N}d {N}h {N}min {N}sec {N}ms Example:  export FORWARDER_STATE_CHECK_PERIOD=10sec LOG_LEVEL logLevel log.level The default log level is INFO. By default, when errors are caught in the Forwarder, only error messages will be logged, without a stack trace. If you need to see the stack trace for debugging or troubleshooting purposes, use the TRACE level. Possible values (case-insensitive): ALL TRACE DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR OFF Note If you are concerned about the security of the password (FORWARDER_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD) and/or key (FORWARDER_ACCESS_KEY) values, using environment variables is the recommended approach. Using Properties File When you want to use a properties-file to configure the Forwarder, follow these steps. Create a new file forwarder-settings.properties  touch forwarder-settings.properties Edit the file and add the following content, specifying all the required values as defined in the table above.  ic.host = ${intelligence-cloud-api-host}\nforwarder.access.key = ${forwarder-access-key}\nforwarder.domain.names = <domain-names-from-web-ui>\nforwarder.keystore.path = <path-to-keystore>/forwarder.jks\nforwarder.keystore.password = <desired keystore password>\nforwarder.port = 443"

Performance impact is negligible because the JVM has already identified this first execution and subsequent calls to the method are not tracked. Identifying Unused Methods Code Inventory tracks first method invocation – it does not reproduce the entire inventory of available code found within source files and bytecode. Developers should compare a Code Inventory report against their codebase to identify classes and methods that are in source but not the Code Inventory: these methods were not executed within the timeframe. Retrieve Code Inventory Results The results of Code Inventory are available through the API, see \"API for Code Inventory\" for more info."

PRESENT: The CVE is present in the classes loaded by the instance, but the instance has not executed the code containing the CVE. Column Description Component The name of the component. If a known component is detected, its name is shown. In all other cases, the jar-filename is in this column. Version The component version. CVE The CVE ID. If the component is not affected by any CVE, the column contains the string \"No CVE impact\". CVE Score The CVE score. CVE Status Indicates whether the code containing the CVE has been executed. Timestamp The timestamp when the CVE was detected. Hostname The hostname of the instance host machine. Instance ID The instance ID. An instance prints its ID to the console at startup if you enable logging of instance IDs.

The runtime will collect information about the libraries inside the application using the Connected Runtime Service (CRS), a component inside the JVM. But only when the argument -XX:AzCRSMode=on or environment variable AZ_CRS_ARGUMENTS are added (for more info, see Connect to Azul Vulnerability Detection via the Forwarder), the runtime will collect information about the libraries inside the application using the Connected Runtime Service (CRS), a component inside the JVM. CRS will transmit these data via the Forwarder. Note Our runtimes only send data regarding the Java runtime and libraries for this very specific functionality. There is no other information exchanged with Azul, and all collected JVM Meta Data in the Saas environment is available to you via our Web UI and API. In contrast to distributions from other providers, Azul will not, and cannot, use this information to check licenses. Forwarder The Forwarder is a separate application provided by Azul to be installed within your environment (at least once, for more info, see \"One-time Setup\"), that will transmit the JVM Meta Data provided by the runtimes to Azul Vulnerability Detection. It requires access to the public internet. Rotating certificates secure the connection between the Forwarder and Azul Vulnerability Detection. Azul Vulnerability Detection Our SaaS solution to detect vulnerabilities in your applications, uses an internal knowledge base containing \"fingerprints\" (hashes) as described on \"How CVEs are Detected\". At this point, Azul doesn’t have any other reference to your code or applications except the info related to the Instance ID."

  "content" : "Capturing the Transmitted Data Using Wireshark Since the data that is being transmitted between the JVMs and the Forwarder is encrypted with TLS, Wireshark needs access to the encryption keys. Use the following steps to be able to capture this data. Configure Wireshark to find the keys: Preferences > Protocols > TLS > Pre-Master-Secret log filename. Specify a local filename. Configure your JVM to put the keys in the file. Use the jSSKeyLog agent. Instructions on downloading and setting up jSSKeyLog can be found at github.com/jsslkeylog. Example:  -javaagent:~/Projects/jSSLKeyLog/jSSLKeyLog.jar=~/Projects/avdtest/conf/sslkey.log Configure Wireshark to capture packets going to the IP address of the Forwarder. Run your Java application that has been configured for CRS and also has the jSSKeyLog agent attached. You should see the packets in Wireshark and when you look an HTTP/JSON packet with URI prefix /crs the payload should be in plain text (readable JSON). To reduce the Wireshark output to just the packets of interest add the following filter:  http.request.method == POST && http.request.uri contains \"/crs\" Save this capture to a file. Note This is important as the next step only works on a saved file, not a live capture. Export the contents of the JSON out of Wireshark into a JSON file. File > Export Packet Dissections > As JSON The resulting file has more details about the HTTP conversation. It is an array that you need to parse to get to another array. Each array item is an HTTP/Post that contains the actual payload in _source.layers.http[\"http.file_data\"]. This payload is a JSON in a string with an array of events. These are the events that CRS sent to the Forwarder. Note Method data does not always have the string name of the class in the event but it does include a classId that can be used to find the class name in other EVENTS. AVD data is sent with an eventName and payload, as described in \"VM Event\".

CRS Tags A tag is a user-defined key-value pair that is associated with an instance. Tags are used to search, categorize, and organize instances logically in the Azul Vulnerability Detection Web UI. Unlike instance IDs, tags are not unique. You can add the same tag to multiple instances as well as add multiple tags to one instance. Applying Tags Tag keys must begin with a letter. Both key and value may contain lower and upper case letters, and numbers. These additional characters are also allowed:  ALLOWED_KEY_EXTRA_CHARS = \"-_.\"\nALLOWED_VALUE_EXTRA_CHARS = \"-_. :/@\" <-- Includes space Note Tags can be provided both as environment variable and in command line options. When using both, the result will be combined. It’s recommended to use environment variables as it allows AZ_CRS_ARGUMENTS to be mostly the same for each JVM. Special Tags A few tags are handled in a specific way with the system: Tag Description Example AppEnv To use the \"Code Inventory Summarization\" feature, you need to configure an AppEnv value on the machine where you run the JVM. The value is, for example, the application name. This information is sent through the Forwarder to the Azul Vulnerability Detection system, together with information about the components, classes, and methods that are used.

As a general rule, tagging should reflect the way you categorize your Java applications. For example, you can use \"west-coast\", \"east-coast\", and so on to distinguish between different availability zones/locations. Note Some instance properties are detected automatically. For example, you don’t have to tag Java versions, because it’s detected by CRS."

  "link" : "https://docs.azul.com/vulnerability-detection/detailed-information/configuration-options#where-to-specify-arguments",
  "content" : "Where to Specify Arguments To enable and configure your instances for CRS, you can choose to use one of these three options: JVM command line arguments The AZ_CRS_ARGUMENTS and CRS_TAGS environment variables A .properties file The connected runtime looks for the configuration parameters in the order described above. You can use a combination of these options. If you set a parameter in several ways, for example via both the environment variable and configuration file, the JVM uses the value that comes first in the order given above. In addition, the Forwarder address can be configured via DNS records. See Service discovery via DNS. Command Line Arguments Pass configuration parameters to the CRS (Connected Runtime Service) in the Azul JVM by using the -XX:AzCRSArguments command line argument: Minimal command that sets the api.url parameter via JVM arguments.:  java -XX:AzCRSMode=on \\\n    -XX:AzCRSArguments=api.url={forwarder_endpoint} \\\n    MyApp A more extended example via JVM arguments:  java -XX:AzCRSMode=on \\\n    -XX:AzCRSArguments=api.url={forwarder_endpoint},log=DEBUG,delayTermination=120000,delayInitiation=0 \\\n    -Dcom.azul.crs.instance.tags={tags} \\\n    MyApp Environment Variables You can use dedicated environment variables to enable and control all JVM processes for Prime and Zulu Core distributions. When the environment variables are present, they will automatically apply to any newly started JVM, enabling CRS. Substitute your forwarder_endpoint in the following example.

  "content" : "Instance States The state of an instance indicates whether the instance is running, offline, or has been terminated. The instance state is detected based on the events that CRS reports to Azul Vulnerability Detection during instance’s lifetime. In the Web UI, the state of an instance is always considered as of now, and is indicated by the following labels: RUNNING: Indicates that the instance is running. The instance sends events regularly. TERMINATED: Indicates that the instance was terminated. A termination event has been received. OFFLINE: The service has not heard from the instance for 5 minutes. This can happen when the instance terminated abruptly and didn’t send a termination event, or when the instance lost connection to the service. The state in the service may differ from the actual state of the instance. For example: An instance is started but CRS is not enabled. In this case, the actual instance continues to run but it is not registered in the service. An instance was connected to the service, but lost the connection at some point. In this case, the actual instance continues to run, but the service sets the state to \"offline\" after a predefined timeout."

The uptime attribute is used together with RuntimeMXBean#getStartTime(), to estimate the actual server time. This means that time stamps, as well as remaining time for a flight recording, can be wrong for processes on machines that have been hibernated. JMC-7071: JFR - Can’t attach to jlinked JVMs This one is still under investigation, but it seems the application can’t attach to certain jlinked images. JMC-7003: JFR - The graph, flame graph view, heatmap view and dependency view does not work on Windows This is due to a problem with the Windows based browser component in SWT.

System.gc() rule There is now a new rule for explicit invocations of System.gc(). Java Flight Recorder Extended compiler type info The compiler type info of frames collected by JFR TickProfiler are extended by 3 more types: C1 Compiled C2 Compiled Falcon Compiled Heat map view A new heat map view has been added, which is handy for seeing when events are taking place. Use Window | Show View | Other…, and select the Heatmap View under Mission Control and click Open to open the view. Websocket for selections There is a new websocket API available that pushes stack trace data from selections in the JFR UI as JSON on a user defined port. This allows for programmatic control of the visualization directly in the browser. Tools like observablehq.com can be used to invent new visualizations, or to alter the visualization. To get started, simply go to the Flight Recorder preferences in JMC, and select the Websocket port to use (0 to disable).

  "content" : "What’s new Zulu Mission Control was rebranded to Azul Mission Control. The names of the distribution packages, executable commands, and configuration files did not change for compatibility. Core New Serializers Core Bundle There is now a new core bundle making it easy to serialize flight recording data to DOT (Graphviz) and Json. This bundle will be expanded upon in future versions. Improved JFR parser performance The performance of the JFR parser has been improved. More improvements are coming in 8.2. Java Flight Recorder (JFR) Support for the new JDK 16 Allocation Events A new form of light weight allocation profiling was introduced with JDK 16 (see https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8257602). This version of JMC supports this new type of allocation profiling. New Page for Peeking into the Constant Pools There is a new page available for taking a look at what constants are available in the recording. This can, for example, be useful when creating custom events to see where all that storage and memory is being used. Open Recordings with .lz4 extension For convenience, files with the .lz4 extension are now attempted to be opened as flight recordings. This is since lz4 is a common compression to use with flight recordings. For flight recordings taken in Azul Platform Prime JVM, added an option to include events from VM’s internal threads (such as GC or compiler threads). JMC Agent Plug-in New JMC Agent Plug-in There is now a new agent plug-in available for JMC, which allows configuring where to emit flight recording events in an already running process.

  "content" : "What’s New JOverflow has been converted to SWT and included in the base Mission Control distribution. JOverflow TreeMap view has been introduced. Now, when analyzing a heap, you can view all types of objects as a tree and drill- down them to identify the source of the memory leak. To open the view: go to Window > Show view > Other… > JOverflow > JOverflow TreeMap. Flight Recorder was updated with the following features: Flame View has been improved. Now you can display the aggregated stack traces for the selected recorded events as a Flame Graph or as an Icicle Graph (inverted). To open the view: go to Window > Show view > Other… > Mission Control > Flame View. Graph View has been introduced. An EA version of the view is now available on the Method Profiling page. The graph displays methods as nodes and calls from one method to another as arrows. Zulu Mission Control Release Notes. To open the view: go to Window > Show view > Other… > Mission Control > Graph View. Note Graph pruning is not yet available. Therefore, it takes a long time to compose and render a large graph and causes the user interface to freeze. To avoid this, use the Max Nodes option to limit the number of nodes loaded into the graph. Predecessors and Successors tabs have been returned to the Method Profiling page. Now you can select (on the Top Method tab) the method where the JVM spends most of its time during application execution and view all methods from which it was called (on the Predecessors tab) as well as methods called from it (on the Successors tab).

  "content" : "What’s New JOverflow has been converted to SWT and included in the base Mission Control distribution. JOverflow TreeMap view has been introduced. Now, when analyzing a heap, you can view all types of objects as a tree and drill- down them to identify the source of the memory leak. To open the view: go to Window > Show view > Other… > JOverflow > JOverflow TreeMap. Flight Recorder was updated with the following features: Flame View has been improved. Now you can display the aggregated stack traces for the selected recorded events as a Flame Graph or as an Icicle Graph (inverted). To open the view: go to Window > Show view > Other… > Mission Control > Flame View. Graph View has been introduced. An EA version of the view is now available on the Method Profiling page. The graph displays methods as nodes and calls from one method to another as arrows. Zulu Mission Control Release Notes. To open the view: go to Window > Show view > Other… > Mission Control > Graph View. Note Graph pruning is not yet available. Therefore, it takes a long time to compose and render a large graph and causes the user interface to freeze. To avoid this, use the Max Nodes option to limit the number of nodes loaded into the graph. Predecessors and Successors tabs have been returned to the Method Profiling page. Now you can select (on the Top Method tab) the method where the JVM spends most of its time during application execution and view all methods from which it was called (on the Predecessors tab) as well as methods called from it (on the Successors tab)."

Temporary recording means that a file is written to the system temporary directory during the time of the recording and is deleted afterwards. This recording file is populated gradually, unlike the file generated using the filename option, which is only populated once the recording finishes. true repository=<path/to/temp/recording> Specifies the path for a temporary recording if the disk option is enabled. /tmp/ filename=<filename.jfr> Specifies the file name of the generated recording.

The dumped recording filename is hotspot-pid-%p-%t.jfr false name=<identifier> Specifies a name identifier for the recording. This is useful when working from jcmd and operating multiple recordings running at the same time. 1,2,3,4,… maxage=<time in specified unit> Controls the maximum number of days the recording should be available on the disk, only when the disk parameter is set to true.

In the same directory, you can find a second configuration profile.jfc which records more events and is useful while profiling an application. You can also create a copy of one these files and create your own configuration, e.g. my-config.jfc."

When such a recording is finished, the results are displayed. After loading a recording, Azul Mission Control displays an automated analysis result as shown below. The overview screen displays recorded data split into categories. Click a node to investigate the corresponding category details. Java Application: Includes data about the recorded Java program workflow: threads life cycle, I/O activity, Exceptions thrown, etc. JVM Internals: Holds JVM activity metrics: Class loading, Garbage collection indices, and other events. Environment: Holds data about the environment where the JVM runs. Event Browser: Displays all the JVM recorded events in the form of a tree."

Low memory errors may not show up during an application testing, but may occur later in the production environment when the Java application uptime increases and objects fill up the Java heap either due to a programmer’s mistake or due to insufficient RAM. Eventually, the heap space shortage may lead to OutOfMemoryError since the Garbage Collector is not able to free up memory because all objects are live.

To create a heap dump, right-click the JVM node you need on the \"JVM Browser\" tab and click \"Dump Heap\". This creates a dump file dump_<connection_time>_<recording number>.hprof that is saved by default to the following locations: Windows: <usr_dir>\\zmc\\<zmc_version>\\ Linux: <usr_dir>/.zmc/<zmc_version>/ macOS: /Users/<usr_dir>/.zmc/<zmc_version>/ Azul Mission Control automatically opens the newly created .hprof file and displays the analysis results in \"JOverflow\". \"JOverflow\" is a Azul Mission Control plugin that aggregates objects with the same types of problems, calculates overhead values, and visualizes this information on charts and tables. If you want to open an arbitrary dump file, click \"File\" > \"Open File\" on the toolbar."

In this scenario, the heap dump has the following view: Select the overhead category. In the Object Selection table, select the entry with the highest Overhead percent. The selected category may be a cause for possible memory leaks. In this scenario, 26% of total heap space is allocated to small collections: Click the Small Collections overhead category to track the potentially leaking classes. Filter the Class. In the Class section, you can view that HashMap is on top of the list and accounts for 34% of the total heap space consumed. Click HashMap and view the Referrer table to identify the source of the leaking object. Drill down the Referring Chain. In the Referrer table, you can view the top-level item mCustomListStruct which indicates a custom Java class. An instance of this class has 10000 references to HashMap objects: Click mCustomListStruct to expand the reference chain, and view problem objects (HashMap) at the bottom of the chain. In this scenario, mCustomListStruct is the only referrer to numerous HashMaps, however, during your investigation you may observe a lot of nested referrers. You can inspect mCustomListStruct usage in the source code and determine whether all the HashMaps references are required. This section shows you how to create and analyze the heap space of a sample Java application and how to reveal possible memory leaks with JOverflow.
